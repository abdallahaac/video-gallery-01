      transcript:
        "<p>Kwe kwe, my name is Isabelle Dallaire. At first glance, I am sure that many of you are probably wondering, well, what is she doing here? It is a platform for Indigenous employees. She doesn't even look Indigenous. That thought is exactly why I decided to share a bit of my story with you today, because I'm convinced that it is through open discuss that we will change things. One small thing at a time.</p><p>Prejudices and stereotypes of the typical image of an Indigenous person are totally normal since you have been taught these preconceived notions for most of your life. Be gentle with yourself. The feeling of guilt that you sometimes feel is normal. Today, I invite you to reflect on your way of thinking to better understand the repercussions that these preconceived ideas can have on Indigenous Peoples in the long term. The way I dress, the color of my hair or the complexion of my skin has nothing to do with the percentage of Indigenous blood that I possess and that runs through my veins.</p><p>Today, I want to help you to become a good ally, to trust you and your empathy, because it is this that will help you make the right choices and have positive reflections on how to ally yourself so that together, we continue this evolution, that we change this way of thinking. Let's take action together today.</p><p>In my case, the impostor syndrome is often present. At meetings, at gatherings, during public speaking, among others. The comments, for the most part, are based on my physical appearance which is considered non-Indigenous. Every time, it makes me want to become very small and hide. And yet, my voice is loud, it is filled with courage, it is filled with strength, with resilience. And I do everything I can to educate people by teaching courses on Indigenous culture. By taking the time to educate myself on the issues and standing up when certain comments can be hurtful so that it does not happen to others.</p><p>I want to tell you that I am hopeful, because every day, as part of my duties as a Human Resources Advisor, on the Indigenous Employee Talent and Career Development team, many will ask me how can I be a good ally. Simple. Be humble. Be curious. Get informed. Recognize as you do today that you cannot know everything, and that there is always room for improvement in our own education about Indigenous Peoples. Every community is different. I hope that my video today has inspired you want to take a few minutes to reflect and also recognize your good work as an ally. It's important to do it. It's important to congratulate yourself.</p><p>I will end by saying, Kwé kwé, I am Isabelle Dallaire, I am a woman, I am blond with blue eyes, Francophone, Indigenous and I proudly come from the Maliseet community of Viger in Cacouna. My hope is that you, in turn, will be proud of your choice to be an ally. Be real. Be you. Be human. Woliwon. Thank you.</p>",

      from: "Danielle White",
      date: "2023-11-1",

      department: "Indigenous Services Canada (ISC)",
      community: "Mi’kmaq, Newfoundland",
      transcript:
        "<p>Kmé kwé, Telusi, Danielle White, Wetapekesi Njuio'gonik Ktaqmkuk. My name is Danielle White. My roots are in Mikmaki  territory on the west coast of Newfoundland, where I grew up, and I'm of mixed Mi’kmaq and settler ancestry and I'm a member of the Allbert Mi’kmaq First Nation.<br><br> At Indigenous Services Canada, I'm the Assistant Deputy Minister of Strategic Policy and Partnerships. What it means to be an Indigenous person in a leadership role in the public service? And one of the things that I'm guided by and it comes a little bit from my background, as I said, I'm of mixed Mi'kmaq and settler ancestry. There are times where I've felt very much like an imposter, very mindful of the privilege I've had. And because of the unique historical circumstances of Newfoundland joining Confederation in 1949, at the time, for better or for worse, the Indigenous populations in Newfoundland were not recognized. They were not registered under the Indian Act, and in some ways there were a lot of positive aspects to that. I think about my own family and if in 1949, my grandfather, who fought in World War Two as a proud veteran, had been registered under the Indian Act, he would have likely lost he would have lost the right to vote, certainly. He would have likely lost many of his veterans benefits, which were something that his family, you know, relied on. His eight children, including my mother, would have been taken away to residential school. But because, you know, those unique circumstances, none of those things happened. My life experience has been quite different in that, you know, I didn't experience many of the disadvantages of what it means to be, you know, a status Indian in this country. But it also means, you know, members of my family hit their identity. They were ashamed of who they were. We lost our connection to our culture, our language, to the broader Mi'kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and New Brunswick. And it's something that our leaders actually, beginning around the time of the White Paper in the 1970s, thought long and hard for, you know, gain that recognition, reclaim our identity and our status. And it was only actually in 2009 that I became, you know, a status Indian registered under the Indian Act, which is a bit of a weird. You know, experience to go through of the way of, you know, asserting and reclaiming your identity is to actually be registered under this very colonial instrument in law that was the path that was chosen by my community and our leadership at the time. <br><br>But for me, it's always meant I've kind of walked in both worlds. And as I get older, you know, have a growing understanding and appreciation for what it means to be Mi’kmaq, I have been learning our language over the last number of years and the insight that provides to our culture and our way of knowing has been really profound. And so when I think about how I approach my work in the public service, there's a philosophy. It's, as I said, a bit like what Nadine talked about a Mi’kmaq philosophy. It's a relational approach that's called Etuaptmumk, and it means to eyed seeing and the ideas that you see from one eye with the strengths and values of the Indigenous world, of Mi'kmaq culture, of our way, ways of knowing and being. But you see through the other eye with, you know, the best of what western, western ways of thinking Western philosophy has to offer. And so, you know, in my work I always try to bridge those two things. And the idea of two eyed seeing, it's not just something that, you know, Indigenous people can practice because it's a way of thinking that acknowledges no one perspective is better than the other, but that, these two Worldviews can exist in harmony, and we need to be informed by one another. And so that in itself creates space for, you know, strength based, trauma informed approaches to our policy and programing. It's, you know, how do we co-exist harmoniously and how do we find that balance in our in our lives and in our work and in our relationships? And most importantly, it means coming to the table with a lot of humility to practice two eyed seeing you don't need to be an expert in Indigenous knowledge.<br><br> What you need to come to the table with is an appreciation that there are things you don't know and that there is inherent value in ways of thinking that are not your own. And I think that's something that very much guides my work. So, I will leave it there. Wela'lioq, thank you. </p>",

      from: "Jnet Ayayqwayaksheelth",
      date: "2022-04-12",
      department: "National Film Board of Canada",
      community: "Ahousaht First Nation - Vancouver Island",
      transcript:
        "<p>Greeting in Nuu-chah-nulth language</p><p>My name is J'net Ayaqwayaksheelth, one who gives away and still stands tall, an Ahousaht woman from the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation. I'm a daughter of Stella August, granddaughter of Ida Swan, August Shish and I have three beautiful children, Ocean, Thee and Taliesen. Thank you for this opportunity to be a part of sharing a testimony. I'm the new-newly appointed Director of Indigenous Relations at Community Engagement at the National Film Board of Canada. And in this role, since September 2022, it's fairly new role, and one of the reasons I wanted to come on board is I've been a civil servant since 2014, working at the Provincial level now at the Federal level.</p><p>I wanted to explore very briefly how I keep my West Coast traditions alive while living in transplanted more than 3500 kilometers away from my homeland. And one of the ways that I'm able to accomplish that is because I myself personally am a textile artist, a cedar bark weaver. I do beadwork lots of amazing ways to keep my traditions going. So one of my ways I wear my art is by putting on my clothes in this particular jacket is from one of my mentors that I look up to from the West Coast, from the Tseshaht Nation in Port of Alberni, Joyce Mahima Little, so when I want to look my best I will wear something Joyce made. And the other way that I'll dress my best is I will wear some of my West Coast jewelry.</p><p>So here's a beautiful Nuu-chah-nulth pendant with our West Coast logo. We all call it the graduation pendant that I got when I graduated from high school. So when I want to represent my community, my nation, I wear that as well. And even on my earrings that are black and red, which is a very iconic West Coast colors, we're not all Heida, by the way. I am Nuu-chah-nulth. We're not one good looking group of people, but what I've got here is a colleagues when I was leaving the provincial museum here to move onto the National Film Board of Canada, she gave me these black and red earrings so even other West Coasters know, like our red and black.</p><p>I'm a cedar bark weaver, here's how we wear our cedar bark hair, headband. My children moderned it up, my youngest wears his backwards. To him, it's more comfortable, it's less itchy he says because the cedar bark often bothers him in the head. And here's my cedar bark hat that I made that with the help of Geraldine, Edgar, Tom. So again, there's lots of ways that I represent my, my culture and cultural wise, I also will bring my, my drum, my West Coast Wild Woman Drum to show that my West Coast ways are represented.</p><p>I do have some tobacco ties and I'm made aware of tobacco ties here or when I'm invited to be part of events and people want to offer me a customary gift, I remind them it is a West Coaster I would prefer a blanket, so I have a lovely collection of blankets. They don't have to be fancy blankets. I do have my my rattle. I don't know if you can hear it, but it doesn't have to be really loud because the ancestors will hear your ceremony. And we often will put our baby's teeth inside our rattles because it remind us who were who were singing for our little ones, our children.</p><p>So there's lots of ways as well through ritual, we have water that I do water ceremony in, in the work that I do, where I'll have water and words that we speak in a meeting will be shared with a living plant at the end, so our intentions continue to grow and I will often bring candlelight, which is often a common culture ritual that we can share across cultures.</p><p>But it's also remembering that as an Indigenous educator, Nuu-chah-nulth educator, I and as an artist, I often remind people that I work with that we don't worship nature as Indigenous people, we learn from nature. So I'll be very mindful of what I wear to meetings if I want to invoke kindness I'll wear hummingbird. If I want to invoke eagle and have objectivity and see a bigger picture, I'll wear something with eagle on it or eagle feather. If I want to be sure to explore a potential and transformation, I'll wear something with butterfly and, you know, bear if I want to be introspective and thoughtful and mindful. So lots of different ways that we can invoke spirit.</p><p>And I will, like I said in another conversation that I live a block away from the Lake Ontario, and I am familiar with the traditions this way, but as a West Coaster living out here, I find it really valuable to keep my West Coast traditions alive and represent my ancestors, even with my little bit of an opening and my candlelight and my water ceremony as a way to show respect for where I came from and keep those traditions alive wherever I live and my children are watching so they also learn how to keep those traditions alive.</p><p>So thanks for thanks for listening. I hope that was helpful. Chuu</p>",

      title: "Huge Shift for Indigenous Recruitment",
      from: "Stephane Romain",
      date: "2022-04-12",
      department: "Indigenous Services Canada",
      community: "Anishinaabe, Kitigan Zibi - Quebec",
      transcript:
        "<p>In the last 10 years, I've seen, I've seen such a huge change, a shift in recruitment and promotion in professional development, supports for language training, supports for Indigenous people coming to work in public service. Young Indigenous University college graduates to come in. It's amazing the progress I've seen.</p><p>Because when they look back 30 years when they said it, I was saying earlier, 30 years ago tried to, you know, build an Indigenous employee network, create a Circle of Indigenous employees and the kind of support each other, join employment equity groups to kind of get a certain small budget to support our colleagues. Indigenous colleagues to also progress in the organization to to where it is now today, which all started in about 10 years ago. Maybe more, maybe less, but not much more.</p><p>With all the programs in place, you know, all the awareness tools that are in place for non-Indigenous employees who join the public service to learn about our histories to learn about, the stories, sometimes very hard stories of our Elders and that they've gone through various difficult stages of their lives throughout Canadian history. But to see this information accessible to public servants is is it's amazing!</p><p>The Canada School of Public Service has an amazing platform where you can learn about so much on Indigenous cultures First Nations, Métis and Inuit and many departments have awareness programs. And one of those programs I used to to manage through the Indigenous Services Canada and developmental programs for Indigenous employees.</p><p>So it's a great place to be in my opinion, if you want to work for government. It's a great place to be as an Indigenous youth or non youth but as an Indigenous person who wants to work for Canada, for the government of Canada, to be part of a team that can change the way things are done in relation to programs and activities to help delivery programs as well that benefit the lives of our Indigenous colleagues, brothers and sisters across this country. I encourage the youth to to really think of a career in the public service.</p>",

      from: "Chantal Chartrand",
      date: "2022-04-12",
      department: "Correctional Service of Canada",
      community: "Innu, Mak Maniu-tenam, North Shore - Quebec",
      transcript:
        "<p>Hello, my name is Chantal Chartrand, my mom is Innue and my dad is a Quebecer. My mom is from Maliotenam, a small village near Sept-Îles. I've been working in government for almost 30 years now. I have worked in several departments. I am currently in the last stages of my career, which I will possibly end with Correctional Services. I say possibly because in life, one never knows. Retiring at such a young age can lead to a lot of other things, and this won't stop after I retire, but I work in Correctional Service as a development officer with the Indigenous community</p><p>As a child at school, I remember that there was a lot of racism. Unfortunately, often thoughout my life and specifically during my youth, I very often thought about ending my life because I was Indigenous, an Innue, and because others made me feel different. This was a really difficult time in my life, but looking back, I see that it really grounded me and gave me the strength that I have today to change things, to make the world a better place. These were not values that I appreciated when I was young, I didn't like to feel so different.</p><p>My mom, having married a Quebecer, she lost her Indian status, so at a very young age my mom was already fighting for her rights, to regain her rights as an Indigenous woman. So I remember going to protests with her at a very young age and I didn't understand the magnitude of this issue at that time, but my thirst for activism started very, very young. I have always grown up in my culture, but at home, we still lived in a little bit of secrecy. </p><p>For example, an event I remember from my youth was when friends came to our house and we ate caribou. At home, everyone was welcome and made to feel at home. We shared food with others as long as there was some. And I remember these people coming to our home and seeing the caribou head and the next day, it went around school that I was a cannibal. It was very hurtful. Afterwards, I think we develop defense mechanisms because I kept telling myself I am not any different than others, besides the fact that I have an Innue mother who has all the love and kindess to welcome others and the spirit of sharing, love and respect.</p><p>Then I was made to experience those differences at school. Later on, when I started my career in government, it was during the Oka crisis and during that crisis, in the workplace, people called names like me dirty savage, cigarette seller even though I had never smoked in my life. So I thought to myself, my God, this is something. My colleagues were angry and I found this behaviour very unacceptable in the work environment because I respected these people. I understood that there might have been some people living on the south shore (Montreal), but I found out about the Oka crisis a little later by educating myself and trying to see what was behind of all this.</p><p>In a nutshell, all this has given me a thirst for truth, a thirst for sharing my culture. I think this is very important because often, stereotypes and prejudices stem from misinformation, fear or ignorance. So, I told myself how can I make a difference, because obviously, I live my culture 24 hours a day. When I'm in the workplace, I always think about the consequences or about the communities. How can I make difference for them? Because these are my roots, my belonging.</p>",

      from: "Chantal Chartrand",
      date: "2022-04-12",
      department: "Correctional Service of Canada",
      community: "Innu, Mak Maniu-tenam, North Shore - Quebec",
      transcript:
        "<p>Considering intergenerational trauma and the social background of First Nations people in my workplace right now, I'm with Correctional Service, so I read clients' criminal files. And then, it takes me back to the past a lot, and it's really heavy and it makes me think, okay, I can understand a little bit better why these people are incarcerated in the first place and also knowing history, everything that happened in the past, that different ways to eliminate us were attempted, to prevent us from emancipating ourselves, to completely take away our culture. I understand why these people are incarcerated and even in my own life, I am learning every day from the reactions, ways or impacts in my personal life.</p><p>For example, I see that with my son, my mom criticizes parental authority a lot, but knowing that my mom went to residential schools, I can tell you that she has been through a lot. She had tuberculosis, she lived through residential schools, she lost her status and later regained as I mentioned earlier. I look at my life story and that of other Indigenous people knowingly.</p><p>For example, I'm going to go back to the fact that my mom criticizes parental authority. It's normal because she didn't have a parent, since she attended residential schools. It was a non-parental authority and her own parents were belittled by them saying that their culture was not beautiful, that they couldn't speak their own language. You really have to adapt and become a civilized person. However, we know very well that First Nations people had their own rules, their own system, they were self-sufficient and they lived respectfully and in harmony with other clans and with Mother Earth.</p><p>So when I consult files or even in my own life, I can make connections with the tragic history of First Nations. It helps me understand a little better and it also makes me proud because let's face it, First Nations have strong resilience having gone through all the events of the past and having survived it all. In fact, Indigenous people do not want to be called victims, that are actually survivors. Today, I clearly understand that even my generation has suffered the consequences of all these traumas and the social repercussions. </p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>My commitment as a person is really I would say 24 hours a day. During Joyce Echaquan's incident, I was in front of my screen when a friend contacted me and said: Chantal, have you seen what's happening on Facebook? There is an Indigenous woman from Manawan who is suffering, who is dying and she is being mocked and ridiculed. I watched the video and it traumatized me. It brought back a lot of racist experiences that I have lived in my life. And that evening, I asked myself, what can I do to make a difference?</p><p>One of Joyce's cousins contacted me and said Joyce has seven very young children up to the age of 18. Joyce was also a grandmother. And then she asked me if I could do something to make a difference. In our communities, when someone dies, the whole community will support by, for example, paying funeral expenses, offering meals to the family, soothing the pain of the family. So that evening I said to myself OK, this is unacceptable, what Joyce suffered doesn't fit into my values. I'm going to start a GoFundMe fundraising campaign to make a difference, to help pay for the funeral expenses. Humbly, I was aiming for 10,000$ for that's about what you have to pay when someone dies. And then, it was important that I meet with the family to tell them my commitment and also to have their agreement, of course.</p><p>First, I started with the idea of going on a vigil at the Joliette hospital because I wanted to denounce the treatment that she had received because  no human being deserves such treatment. Finally, a lot of people got on board. And then, there was a vigil the day after she died. I met the family. Fortunately, in my current department, I offer peer support. This has helped me a lot in the correctional services environment, to have an approach in crisis situations like this as we still experience a lot of them. And then, I met the family and they welcomed me and I gave them my word, my commitment that I was there for them. I think a mom is priceless. And then I told them, listen, I'm going to help you with funeral expenses.</p><p>I started a fundraising campaign and in the end we raised 350,000$. And then, my commitment was to the children, to the family. I first opened accounts for each of the children and each one of them had an amount deposited for later, when they reached the age of majority and also to provide care, if there was immediate care necessary or at least to be able to enjoy little pleasures for the time being. I felt that this tragedy should not remain silent.</p>",

        "<p>Hi, my name is Michèle Elliott. I am a Mi'kmaq woman whose maternal lineage comes from Nova Scotia. I was raised in North Bay on Algonquin Territory. My father comes from Algonquin and French heritage. I moved to Ottawa at 18, which is also an Algonquin territory. This is where I became more involved and connected to the Algonquin culture.</p><p>My life has always been about helping others. And since I've been in government over 14 years, it's been about helping Indigenous employees on their career path. I used to be the lead of two Indigenous developmental programs and would offer advice to our participants. I would also provide career guidance to other employees and colleagues.</p><p>In 2017, I was lucky enough to be hired as the first Indigenous navigator at First Nations and Inuit Health Branch within Indigenous Services Canada. I was assisting Indigenous employees in the navigation of their careers by offering advice and guidance, as well as by helping them find staffing opportunities and being successful on staffing processes.</p><p>A few years after that, I was telling others about my dream to develop an Indigenous Career Navigators' Program and to implement navigator roles in all departments and agencies so that all Indigenous employees across government could benefit from these services. Well, I am happy to say that my dream has come true. Navigators have been selected in some departments, and others are currently being selected. Training for navigators started this April 2022. All navigators will be part of the Indigenous Career Navigators' Circle, which will meet once a month to share best practices and to support one another as we support our Indigenous employees.</p><p>I am so grateful to everyone who has supported me in my efforts to increase the recruitment, the retention and the advancement of Indigenous Peoples. Supporting Indigenous employees in a cultural and safe environment is so very important to me. I am happy that the federal government gives me the opportunity to do just that. Thank you so much. </p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>Kuei, hello, let me introduce myself, Kathleen Jourdain, I am Innue from the community of Uashat mak Mani-Utenam. So today, what I wish to share with you is a little about my experience in the public service. I have recently arrived to the public service, since almost 8 weeks ago. I am a senior manager on the liaison team at the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch for the Quebec Region. This is part of Indigenous Services Canada.</p><p>I wanted to share with you my perspective and my way, my vision of my Indigenous culture. So, as I mentioned, I am Innue and this culture has been transmitted to me mainly through my mom. So we lived in the city, in Sept-Îles, but also in the community in Uashat itself. So, I have some experience, I would say I have a vision of two worlds that I would call, the urban environment and the one in community. In my life, I would say my personal experience has been rather positive. Of course, like most of us, there have been some instances of racism or rather ignorance of the culture despite the proximity to Sept-Îles, particularly between the Innue Nation and the Quebec nation, the sept-îlien and sept-îlienne who live the region. Yes, but throughout my life journey, whether at school or in the workplace, it has been greatly positive.</p><p>What I would like to share with non-Indigenous people in Canada is not to be afraid of being curious, and do not be afraid not to use the wrong terms either, and we are very politically correct, if I can put it that way. But there are people who have approached me and asked which tribe are you from. It's important to have this openness, not to take it the wrong way, and then to inform people that we call it a Nation. My nation is the Innue Nation. And, in Quebec, this represents nine communities, mainly on the North Shore, but also in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. It's things like that and not to be afraid to ask questions because I think that through this curiosity, it brings beautiful exchanges and a better knowledge of our cultures.</p><p>And I speak about the Innue culture, because it's mine. I've been in contact with other Indigenous cultures in the country, mainly in Quebec, but, and it's expressed in different ways. So, maybe for another Indigenous person, the word tribe does not appear as derogatory as it could be for another Indigenous person in another region or another province. So, that's what I want to share with you, to be open, to be curious, to dare to ask questions, to dare to ask. And then, I would like to tell you that for the moment regarding my new experience, in the public service, there is a great openness, there are beautiful projects, beautiful programs that are being put in place for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, to improve knowledge of the different Indigenous cultures in Canada, but also to ensure that there is a greater presence of Indigenous people in the public service.</p><p>So, I would invite Indigenous people in this country to dare to come forward, if they are interested in a career in the public service, apply. Sometimes it's just about talking to someone who is in the public service environment and then to see if there are opportunities, openings, because in my case, it was really an unexpected opportunity. I would say it just came to me, without forcing things and it is going really well. So to summarize, I hope that we can move forward together, work together, know each other better and build a bridge, make better connections, for a healthier and smoother cohabitation. But as I said for me personally, I haven't experienced any big trauma, but I know that for other people, it's different.</p><p>So there it is, I wish you all a good learning journey and great discoveries with the nations and Indigenous Peoples in Canada.</p>",

      community: "Mohawk, Six Nations Community - Ontario",
      transcript:
        "<p>Hello. Hi there shé:kon. My name is Samantha White and I am from the Six Nations community. I am a Mohawk Turtle Clan member. I am a daughter, I'm a sister, I'm an auntie, and right now, I'm a public servant. Something close and dear to me that I have been hearing a lot is I hear the same census data that Indigenous youth will become the largest untapped human resource and labor force. I get really protective of Indigenous youth when I hear this. So my story is intertwined with the public service because I was afforded the opportunity to attend college and university.</p><p>I grew up mostly in the Six Nations and Hamilton area, so I was all around a lot of urban natives, as I say. So I know so many people who can do as I have done but haven't had the same opportunity, and that's not fair. So a large part of my adult life now works to address that inequity for my own people back home. If I can lead by example, that's my first step. The second is preparing the system for our people, for our Indigenous youth. And again, this is where my protectiveness comes out.</p><p>So my path was headed towards the not for profit sector, and it wasn't until I was actually rejected from the original program choice at the University of Ottawa that I accepted their alternative option for me...But it turns out I absolutely loved the program. I can't say enough about my experience at the University of Ottawa and especially the Indigenous Resource Center. I lived there, so it's through safe spaces like the Indigenous Resource Center that I was able to attend a targeted recruitment initiative for Indigenous students. Now this initiative, it's called the Indigenous Student Employment Opportunity, which is still open now. So, if you're an Indigenous student, please, I encourage you to apply. They're not paying me, I swear.</p><p>So I entered the public service as a student in 2018 from that opportunity. And now, after a couple of summers in different organizations, I find myself where I'm at now. So I'm an H.R. Advisor, and it's been a full circle moment for me as some of the work I do now involves the ISEO program, Indigenous Student Employment Opportunity, and supporting Indigenous students. So it's right now as though I'm giving back, which feels really good to me.</p><p>But now that I'm here and I've been in this role, I've been noticing some things, I guess, like how we know it's a pretty, horrible experience to apply to work for the public service, especially for Indigenous Peoples. The education and language requirements have us taking ourselves out of the running before we even start. Actually, like I did, I never thought I could work for the government, for the public service, because I don't speak French and I absolutely believe I know to be true, had I not attended the University of Ottawa and subsequently the Indigenous presentation for the ISEO program, I wouldn't be here speaking to you now, at all. And I feel a hundred and I feel 1,492% worthy and capable that I can do my job and I can do it well. And I know other Indigenous People out there just like me, who just need this chance, need these targeted recruitment opportunities like I have had.</p><p>So I see and am a part of many great working groups and I help support in any way I can through my position. But I want to be very clear that I don't want to get Indigenous youth ready for the public service. Rather, I'm working the opposite end of this with my protectiveness around youth. That and in everything that I've seen with my career, right now, I'm aiming to get the public service ready for Indigenous youth. Indigenous Peoples lived experience account for important learning opportunities, just like the opportunities afforded when taking the traditional higher Western education path, the path favored by educational requirements when staffing the public service, and that's not fair. How are we to breathe new air into a space when that space has barred it? On the same note, now many positions require bilingual language profiles as well. If you look at the statistics or if you speak to any community member, you'll understand how important language is, but rather recapturing our own that was taken.</p><p>With just those two gaps identified, I can already tell you that the work that needs to be done to address this must also come from Indigenous Peoples. Meaning to change the staffing of the public service so that it is inclusive and not just to Indigenous Peoples, but to everyone. We must have representation from all equity groups at the table and clear dialog, something I know many people right now are currently doing.</p><p>So, I stepped back, with the last sort of thing that I do want to put out there is that my path again, as I said, started with rejection. I got, actually I got rejected in college, too, from my program, so maybe it's just normal for me to kind of get rejected and come back. But I think wherever your path leads you, you go, right? I don't want to put it out there that all of this is because I went to university and I went to school and now I'm a public servant, you don't have to do any of that. You know, I don't believe Indigenous Peoples all should work in Indigenous Service Canada, you know, I believe we should be everywhere. If you're an Indigenous person and you like math, be an accountant. You shouldn't be forced to work on Indigenous files as well.</p><p>So for me I think that I want to put it out there that all education is important and I was again rejected and I still found my way here to this amazing place. So any path that any schooling is so important to me. I believe in trade schools. I believe in language camps. I just believe in anything that helps and heals your soul is good for you. And so with that, I believe those experiences that you learned from those other those other experiences will be funneled into the public service. And through that, we will change completely change the paradigm of how we're thinking. So, I think that was a lot that that there. So for me I do just want to thank you for listening and that hopefully if if I can instill anything in anybody it's that somebody like me from growing up growing up in Hamilton that doesn't speak French, that they had no idea that I worked for the Government, that this is where I'm at now. And and you can do it as well. So, thank you so much. Niawen'kó:wa! I look forward to hopefully working with some of you in the future. Thank you.</p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>Hi, bonjour, kwe kwe. My name is Jacinthe Grondin. I work as a policy analyst for Indigenous Services Canada. But who am I? I am a woman. I am a daughter. I am a child. I am a granddaughter. I am a spouse. I am grandmother and I am a friend and a colleague. I am Algonquin from my mother's side, so I am mixed ancestry. Algonquin from my mother's side, Lac des Deux Montagnes, but I was raised in a French Canadian environment. </p><p>My family history is such as many women were my caretakers, primary caretakers in my life. There was my natural mother, my adoptive mother, was also Algonquin and my grandmother, the mother of my father, who was from Beauce. But, and I will talk about her later. So, the Algonquin, Indigenous origin of my mother had never been denied at home. It was clear, it was there. It was said on a regular basis, especially when my father mentioned how my grandfather was not eating well like he should be. But it was okay because it was just a 'savage'. So, not being, not behaving like my mother's family was the point for us to be to put forward as a French Canadian family what we needed to succeed.</p><p>We were from Beauce from my father's side, and that was very clear. Even if I was not born in Beauce and never lived in Beauce, and it wasn't like I went to Beauce very little times in my life, being from Beauce was very strong in my family. And that was pushing us for success. We needed to have education. We needed to learn English, which obviously I learned late in my life, and we needed to check the box of all the obstacles on our path for success.</p><p>My natural mother succeeded very well. If it was not because of the Indian Act application that made a woman lose her status, when she married the white man, she would have lost her status for many reasons, including her master's degree. My grandmother who was from Beauce, as mentioned before, she was fascinated by Indigenous teachings, and she was born in 1901. So, early in her life she got along well with Abenakis and that and got her and received a lot of Abenakis teachings that she passed on to me when I was a young kid because I walk with her and she was my primary caretaker. So all of those Abenakis teachings was part of me and she is the one who taught me how a poison plant comes with a solution, an antidote just beside and in your life that translates in that you have a problem, then there's a solution just beside of it.</p><p>So, there's also her who taught me how to talk with rocks and stones. And my ancestry is through that and my grandparents and ancestors. So, that was part of my DNA, that became part of my DNA. When my parents separated and I met my adoptive mother, I was 11 the first time, and the connection was strong. It was like love at first sight. I fell in love with her. We shared the same connection with the land, with the herd, with the nature, with animals. And she, I could share safely the teachings of my grandmother with her. And she validated those teachings, and sometimes she corrected that. So we went in the woods many times together. We were harvesting. The story for my father was we are harvesting today some strawberries and we've prepared pie for him to then to satisfy his need to know but so many stories, so many teachings she passed on to me at that time.</p><p>Unfortunately, she passed when I was seventeen, and that created a big gap in my life, a big, big gap. I became a mother at the age of twenty, twenty-one and not having the loving, the love of my adoptive mother and the support was like &ldquo;who do I belong to?&rdquo;, I lost a sense of belonging there. So, I focused my attention to make a great living for my sons. I had two sons. I was a single mother, and I had the pressure to succeed for them to make a better living for them and to get rid of the stigma of being a single mother trying to make a career at the same time.</p><p>When I joined the public service 15 years ago, after being in law practice for a while, I was very, very attracted by the Indigenous issues and the reconciliation and services and that need for connection. But I was so afraid of rejection, of being told that I don't belong there and that then it was like I was working around the issue until I became, I felt that I was afraid of being called an imposter.</p><p>Then I became a grandmother, my granddaughter arrived. And then the call for me was, oh, my God, I do have to affirm who I am, to pass it on to my granddaughter. I'm in touch with my grandmother. I have my granddaughter on the other end, and the sense of seven generations, that its nurture and value in Indigenous communities became real, very real for me everyday, on a daily basis, I touch five generations. So, seven generations is not that long time. So, this need, inner need to embrace that, in conjunction with having all these initiatives for Indigenous employees, put in place and promoted within the public service, allowed me to connect with some elders and to be more in touch with other groups and employees who face the same situation and same life journey of reappropriation.</p><p>So, having that puts me like, okay, I can nurture, I can progress, and I feel like I could finally be myself. Add all the aspects of who I am, the vowels and consonants together to have a full speech of who I am. I'm not half bilingual, even if English is not my strongest language. It's not like 50% English, 50% French. I speak both languages. It's the same thing. I'm Indigenous. I'm also French Canadian, and I want to embrace all that reality together, in my daily life, and professional and personal.</p><p>So today, the big gift in my life, that I've been given through my reconciliation journey is having my natural mother, who is 85 years old now, helping her claim back the Indian card and the Indian status, even if it's an archaism of the patriarchal policy, claiming the same status of her family and walking her path to the sacred teachings that we have this discussion about that, sacred teachings and all the Indigenous teachings to help her heal her own journey and wounds from that past history.</p><p>So all of this to say, I'm more than grateful and chi miigwetch, chi miigwetch. Thank you, <span lang=\"fr\">merci</span>.</p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>Kwe Kwe, my name is Jolie-Ann Héroux-Brazeau. I am currently working for Indigenous Services Canada, but more specifically for FNIHB. So I work for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. I have been a liaison officer since May 2022, so since May 2022, I have had the opportunity to work directly with Indigenous communities. Nin Anisnhabeekwee, which means I am an Algonquin woman. I am a member of the Anishinaabe Nation of Lac-Simon, in Abitibi.</p><p>So, first I'd like to share my story with you because it's going to really help you understand why I decided to work for the government and how my work is helping me heal myself not only as an individual, but as a First Nations woman. So, at the age of five, I was removed from my biological family to grow up in Youth Centres. So, I lived in several foster families, several group homes, shelters. So for me, connecting to culture was never something that was part of my childhood. Then it was at the age of 27 that I decided to give myself this beautiful gift, to reconnect with my traditional culture. It is also at the age of 27, that I also started working for the government. Currently, I am almost 30 years old, so I've been working here for two and a half years.</p><p>Now I am going to tell you how my work has actually allowed me to reconnect with my history, to reconnect with my true identity. So when I work with Indigenous communities, I can really see the resilience of communities. And that is really a strength, and it is really a beautiful gift that life has given me to be able to see how Indigenous communities are able to take charge of themselves, to find their own tools, and also how they organize themselves together to improve the quality of life, to be able to heal themselves as a people, and for me, that is really something that is very, very inspiring in my life.</p><p>I am also the co-chair of the Indigenous Employees Network at work. So it's me, in fact, who co-chairs a network where there are several Indigenous employees. We often organize conferences. So I'll give you an example of a conference that I organized with an Elder who came to speak at a regional discussion. So a discussion with federal public servants. So the Elder came to tell the story of her mother who grew up in residential schools, and then the employees were so deeply touched that there were some employees who started to cry.</p><p>So for me too to see that there are other employees who are non-Indigenous, who are really committed to the reconciliation process. I also like to say the process of reparation because for me, that's what I do, working for the government, it's repairing and helping communities, supporting them in the whole healing process that they're undertaking. Then it also heals me too, myself, as an individual. So to see other employees who are also as committed as I am, it's really something that's very, very powerful, that helps me a lot in my personal life as well. We agree that historically, the government has not always been fair with Indigenous communities. But I think that now, in 2022, we are really in an era of change, of evolution. And for me, as a woman, to contribute to that is really something that makes me grow as an individual. So for real, ever since I've been working for the public service, I've just had good, good feelings inside of me.</p><p>So there you go, I hope you enjoyed my video. So Miigwetch for having listened to me. I wish you a nice day.</p>",

        "<p>Kwe. Hello. Bonjour. My name is Andrew Caldwell and I am a Policy Analyst with Employment and Social Development Canada.I am status Algonquin, Anishinaabe, First Nations and Settler descent from the Kitigan Zibi, Anishinabeg community located in Maniwaki, Quebec.<br></p><p>My Anishinaabe name is Wa- Wa - Ti - In - In - Ne, which means Northern Lights Man.My personal colors are green and white and my clan colors are red and black from the Bear Clan.I identify as Two- Spirit, although my peers experience me as androgynous at times, I fall into, I present as a cis- gender, a cis - normative male. My preferred pronouns are he, him and they.<br></p><p>My Kokomis, Algonquin grandmother, was sent to residential school in Spanish, Ontario and was directly impacted by colonization.She died at a young age in a car accident, and her children were raised in foster homes.My mother, who raised me, was one of those children.My mother and her siblings grew up not knowing each other, as a result of being in the Sixties Scoop system.They also grew up not knowing about their Algonquin culture or spirituality, as a result of the effects of the residential school and being in the Sixties Scoop system.<br></p><p>My mother, however, shares that she remembers her mother being a Medicine Woman and that she was able to heal physical and emotional wounds with plants from Mother Earth.My mother raised my sister and I on her own, and as a child I recall seeing her oppressed and discriminated against because of the color of her skin and her long black hair, because she looked Indigenous.And she did her very best to raise my late sister and I as she waited on tables and she cleaned houses.And as a result of being in the foster care system and in view of her mother being a residential school survivor, she did not have parenting skills.However, she was very supportive of my development as a child.<br></p><p>I did not know if I was a boy or a girl, but I knew I was attracted to other males.I knew that I was different from others, and she allowed me, my mother and my late sister to be who I was.They supported my love for pop star Madonna, where I used to dance around and sing to her videos.And I had long hair as a child and I was very flamboyant and both of them were very supportive of my development and celebrated who I was.<br></p><p>And throughout my school years, I struggled with my gender identity and my gender expression, sexual orientation and having Indigenous heritage.I have been subjected to homophobia, transphobia and racism.And during this time in my life I lacked direction and clarity in my life, so I was encouraged by my mother to attend a healing center up in Kitimat at Wilp Si'Satxw Healing Center.<br></p><p>I realized that my life was going nowhere and I made the decision to attend.And it was at Wilp Si'Satxw where a female Elder told me that if I did not deal with who I was, in terms of my gender identity and sexual orientation, that things would get worse for me. The Elder informed me that I was Two-Spirit, which meant I was given male and female energy. She told me that this was a sacred gift because I could understand and mediate between both genders. As gifts from the Creator, the Elder told me that it was important to continue on my healing journey in order to embrace the gift of having two spirits. After that moment, I remember feeling at ease and very grounded.<br></p><p>Indigenous Nations have had specific language and terminology for gender identity, expression and sexual orientation since time immemorial.Due to the impacts of colonization and the residential school experience, many nations are working on reclaiming their traditional language and practices.The term Two - Spirited is attributed to Albert McLeod, who proposed its use during the Third Annual Inter - Tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian American Conference, held in Winnipeg in 1990, in order for Indigenous LGBTQ + community members to have an urban expression for their identity.<br></p><p>Two - Spirit is an English term that can be defined as an Indigenous identity that is gender variant or of same sex attraction or pansexual and of spiritual and cultural roles.The definition of Two - Spirit does not neatly fit into the Eurocentric categories of gender identity and gender expression as they vary from tribe or nation.It is important to note that the complexities of Indigenous histories and practices, the concept of Two - Spirit does not apply to all Indigenous identities.Due to European contact, the Two - Spirit identity was denied by many Indigenous communities.It is important to decolonize the Two - Spirit identity so it can reclaim its traditional role within the Indigenous communities.Various Indigenous activists and scholars are now working towards this reclamation.<br></p><p>In current day, there are trainings and workshops for individuals who seek to gain an understanding of the Two - Spirit identity and explore ways to build respectful relationships and foster vibrant communities amongst Two - Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ + people.The Two - Spirit community is actively working towards reclaiming their unique status in their communities. As a Two - Spirit person, I continue to seek the language and more teachings on what it looked like within my Algonquin community.I am proud to be working for the public service as I feel included and celebrated for who I am as a diverse employee and grateful to connect with others in the Equity and Diversity Networks. Thank you for listening to me.All my relations.Chi - Miigwetch.Merci.</p>",

        "<p>Good morning, Tansi. My name is Colin Oakes.I'm from the Nekaneet First Nation, Southwest Saskatchewan. I'm a manager of operations at Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge, Prairie Region, Correctional Service Canada.I've been here since about 13 years and I started out here in a different capacity. But now I'm, now I do the work I do.I feel very fortunate to work on our Nekaneet First Nation.This is where the Okimaw Onci Healing Lodge is located at.I'm driving, going home, going to work under 4 minutes is so great. <br></p><p>We have a fair amount of First Nations staff on site. We have a fair amount also from the Nekaneet, First Nation. That's pretty ideal not only for them, but their relatives that we have other First Nations people that come here. I think the commute for them is approximately 20 minutes, 30 minutes.<br></p><p>The thing that I enjoy about being First Nations and working here is the fact that this is in line with what we do at Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge. When this place was built and completed in 1995, the intent back then was to have an equal amount of correctional cultural story interventions or ways of dealing with our federal female offenders, and also a partnership with what would be called law and policy. And there was a good intent there. And I think it's a challenge every day, I guess, when you have that partnership.<br></p><p>We had a good, strong group of Elders that used to work here back then. Many of those Elders are no longer around now, unfortunately, but we have another group of Elders that work with the women also. I enjoyed the part about this job as I do a fair amount of departmental or CSC interactions, meetings, videoconferences. But there are times I can pretty much step outside my office door and speak with the offenders that are walking by. I'll say good morning.<br></p><p>When this place was opened back in 1995, many of the Elders that worked here, there was probably no how to work with the federally sentenced female offenders back then. So the intent that they had back then was to treat them like relatives, like they were their granddaughters or grandnieces or something. They treated them like family but they also had expectations. And in a way, they're able to probably, I guess their interactions were very culturally based, I guess. You know, they're basically, you know, raising grandchildren, also helping raise grandchildren.<br></p><p>So that was the idea they took back then. And that was like, as I said, 1995, now that we're in 2022, there's still a few of us that are from Nekaneet that we still have that mindset. I always tell them that they're part of the community, they're part of our extended family. So I think in that way, there's that good expectation that you have of them. There are also moments that you probably have those discussions with them that you have to, for the lack of a better term, set them right. And sometimes those types of discussions probably aren't too great for them, but they understand.<br></p><p>I'm also of the understanding that when the women come here, they're here to work on themselves. Like if you ever been out here, ever seeing pictures, where we're pretty much in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing nearby to distract them, like, you know, a car lot, a block away or anything like that. They're here to work on themselves. And that way they do all the work on themselves. They do the work where we just kind of point them in the direction, the various departments, the Operations Department, the Programs Department, the Assessment and Interventions Department, they pretty much try to point in their direction and all of them do the work themselves.<br></p><p>And when they leave, there's sometimes we do get contacted by women who've, you know, gone past what is called a warrant expiry date. And they'll call us here just to say they're doing good. They're keeping some of the things that they kept from here at Okimah Ohci Healing Lodge sometimes they even go so far to specifically name an Elder or they'll name one of the staff to say thank you so and so for telling me those words. They make so much sense right now that, you know, they're glad they had this opportunity.<br></p><p>So, yeah, that's it's kind of one of the main reasons why Okimaw Ohci had chosen Nekaneet and I guess was our cultural way of life here. I again feel fortunate to grow up in this manner. So it's and at that earlier generation, you know, raised the younger generation. They kept us doing a lot of the cultural events. And that's something that we do now. I'm kind of at the age where I'm kind of one of the guys that sit around and kind of watch and make sure the younger group are doing the right things. And, but that's just how it goes.<br></p><p>So, it's up to us to, I guess to keep that cultural interventions, cultural interaction going. I feel fortunate and feel very lucky to be doing this on a regular basis. And yeah, there may have been one or two times that somebody phoned here to say thank you to call. And so, that's all I have to say. I, do want to add that I watched the other videos. I thank you for your sharing that that's a lot to do and that's a good thing. So thank you very much, Hiy Hiy.</p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>Hello. Kwe. My name is Marlene Lamarche. I am an Algonquin from Kitigan Zibi Anishinaabeg. I currently work at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada in the Treaties and Aboriginal Governments Business Management Unit. I was the first Indigenous woman hired in the public service.</p><br><p>In 1990, I applied for a position in the government and to my surprise at the time there were no other Indigenous women working for the government. I had an awkward interview. I was made to sit in a darkened room at a large boardroom table with a panel of 12 individuals who proceeded to ask me all kinds of questions from personal to professional. I was told that it was the usual way interviews were conducted, but that I was the last to be interviewed that way as they were changing the way government interviews would be conducted in the future. I learned later on that that was a lie. I was singled out because I was a native woman.</p><br><p>I told myself that I had to be strong for my people, as I was a kind of an ambassador for my people. So I stood my ground and kept my head up and placed my hands under my knees so that I would not fidget or make overly wide gestures. I knew that any untoward movement on my part would be used to judge me and all Indigenous people wanting to work in the government in the future. And I succeeded. I got the job. Yay me!</p><br><p>For the remainder of my position at that first place, I made sure to conduct myself to the utmost level of professionalism, always being on time, always dressing for success, and never gossiping about anyone. Accepting any and all work asked and offering to help others when my workload allowed it. I told myself that at any time, if I didn't conduct myself that way, it would be an excuse for them to let me go to continue to not hire Indigenous people in the government. I felt a heavy weight on my shoulders in those days.</p><br><p>It was not until I started with the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that I felt more accepted as I was no longer the only Indigenous employee working for the government then. I was part of the Sixties Scoop. I was sent to live in foster home when I was three years old and lived at nine different foster homes before I turned 18.</p><br><p>As the Bill C-31 came into force that year, I personally went to my band office and applied for my status card. I told my band office members my story and they welcomed me with open arms and gave me a new sense of belonging that I had never had before. I then started to attend Powwows and visited my relatives on the reservation to absorb as much culture and information as I could. I kept going to visit my cousins, aunts and uncles and my grandmother when she was still alive. She taught me about our clan, which is the Bear clan and what it meant. It gave me a foundation as a member of the band that I had been missing.</p><br><p>I was placed with white families who didn't care about me and made me feel like my life didn't matter. I decided that there was a purpose for my life after attempting to commit suicide 3 times at a very young age. Since fate kept making me fail in death, I came to believe that there was a purpose to my life and that I would look for what that purpose was.</p><br><p>I believe that Indigenous people may very well be the salvation of this country. It is important for as many of us to join the government as possible in order for us to influence the direction of the country. I now see some of the ways Indigenous people have changed the ways Canadian view us. And let me tell you, it's getting better and better every year. I used to be afraid to walk into a coffee shop in downtown Ottawa in the eighties. They would look at me like I was some kind of monster when I was just a small girl, for goodness sakes, what was I going to do to them?</p><br><p>Native people see themselves as steward of the land. We are not now, nor have we ever attempted to take all of the resources of the land. The land must be protected so that our progeny can live. It is my hope that Indigenous people will live in a world where they are no longer seen as third class citizen and can have clean drinking water and warm homes to live in and where they can hunt and fish for subsistence without the fear of running out of fish and wildlife.</p><br><p>It's been an exhausting 25 plus years that I've been in the government and I'm looking forward to retirement. I've had my share of discrimination and prejudice over the years. I have mixed feelings about leaving, but I hope that Indigenous public servant will have it easier because of my contribution and dedication. I tried my very best to teach non-native public servant about my people in order to demystify all the misunderstanding about our culture. So carry on my people. But carry a big stick. Miigwetch.</p>",

        "<p>Hi, I'm Manon Lacroix, I've been 35 years in the government. I'm Algonquin from the Kitigan Zibi, but I've not lived in the community. To me, decolonization has been important since the beginning.<br></p><p>I started in the government, because of the culture has not been passed on to me some people took me under their wing, and they were, I really have gratitude for these people. A lot of them I missed, they are retired now, and some are gone. My mentor is gone. They took me under their wing to let me learn many cultures. And decolonization to me is what I've always learned is that you're able to voice how you feel to anyone in respect, of course, but with your heart and honesty that we are able to live in a work community that the hierarchy is not as important.<br></p><p>I'd like to be able to just knock at the door of my DM to share some thoughts about something we're planning for recruitment for Indigenous People. Or just say, you know, I think it's being overlooked that we should be working more on the retention of our actual Indigenous employees because we don't want them to leave, pass on their corporate memory, be there for the next generation coming behind me. I would like to be able to share what I learned. And to me, it's a way to thank my mentors and people that helped me throughout my career.<br></p><p>Hierarchy is important for work to be delivered so that we know our plans and there are different levels of experience and education. But it's not important when it comes to communicating how you feel and for the work environment. So, the payroll, does not become important anymore, it is really appreciated when the person is genuine and there to listen, that we work together, that the Indigenous employees' networks are consulted, or when colleagues elsewhere are developing a great initiative, not only consulted but kept in the loop. It's one thing to consult and say, I've consulted you regarding this initiative we're doing, but then you hear nothing, no news until it's just launched and there's no more opportunity to give feedback in case it was needed.<br></p><p>Many Voices One Mind report card is very important to be in constant link with their Indigenous employees. Those that are known, I know that the self ID issue is one thing, but there are always willing Indigenous employees that have identified themselves and said that they're willing to be contacted, even if there's one, two or ten or 20, there's always some. Yes, we have our work to do. We can ask those that are just voluntary and those networks at certain time because they want to be able to advance in their regular day job. Many are there and it would be our pleasure to help advance in the many areas for decolonization.</p>",

      department: "Public Services and Procurement Canada",
      community: "Northern Manitoba Cree",
      transcript:
        "<p>My name is Jolene Head. I am a member of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation in Northern Manitoba. I've been a public servant for over 20 years, starting in the Winnipeg Office of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, where I spent the bulk of my career. And I've just recently moved to the Acquisitions Branch to lead the Indigenous Procurement Policy Directorate. <br></p><p>In terms of my thesis, my thesis title is Deconstructing Colonial Practices in the Federal Public Service and where I got the idea for my thesis? The topic came from my interest in leadership theory, which is the basis of the master's program that I participated in, and as well for my involvement in reconciliation as an indigenous public servant. But I think more importantly is the personal connection to reconciliation as a Cree woman. And my decision was also based on my personal observations and reflections that there was and is something not quite right about the public services approach to reconciliation.<br></p><p>I think it is important to decolonize before reconciliation because based on the research, both from the literature and information shared by Niwâkomâkanak, it indicates that reconciliation cannot occur in the absence of addressing the systemic barriers that exist in the public service. The public service system and culture are colonial constructs which have created legislation and policies that have caused irreparable damage to First Nation, Métis and Inuit Peoples in taking steps to decolonize as much of the system and culture as we can.<br></p><p>Recognizes and acknowledges the truth of not only the historical impacts they have had on First Nation, Métis and Inuit, but also the truth about how it perpetuates ongoing colonization against Indigenous Peoples. It's for this reason that I argue that decolonization is an essential process, that reconciliation needs to support and not the other way around. Reconciliation cannot occur without decolonization efforts. Anything less ignores the systemic barriers that continue to exist and turns a blind eye to the culture that maintains those systemic barriers.<br></p><p>So in my opinion, the biggest, the two biggest obstacles are the public service system itself and the culture and people that maintain that system. It's a massive system, and it's overwhelming to think about changing it in a substantial way. However, the research clearly points to the need to do just that if we want to tackle complex problems effectively. Public servants are part of that system and the current culture maintains the status quo.<br></p><p>So we also need to change the culture moving towards one that is committed to challenging the status quo, to becoming a truly inclusive culture, and to deconstructing colonial practices to make Canada equitable in its treatment of minoritized populations like Indigenous Peoples. And what I'm currently seeing is a grassroots movement by public servants who are demanding these changes. And what we need now is true commitment and action, which includes dedicating time and resources by senior leadership. Senior leadership points to EDI (Equity, Diversity and Inclusion), anti-racism and the Many Voices One Mind as evidence of progress. However, some of these initiatives are flawed, and in many ways they're actually maintaining the status quo because they are not truly addressing the systemic issues inherent in the system. So the actions may actually be perceived as performative.<br></p><p>I think embracing discomfort, particularly in the context of work around social justice issues such as reconciliation. It means growth. It means self-reflection. It signals a need for changing one's thoughts, biases and behaviors. I think it is the place for growth and learning. And this is the place where change happens. It is for this reason, as a public service, we need to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. It provides the space to have these uncomfortable but essential and real discussions on topics such as reconciliation, which I hope will then lead to action both at the systemic level as well as individual.<br></p><p>I was surprised and still am surprised by the interest in my thesis. I honestly thought it would go the way many other reports, inquiries and commissions have gone, shelved and ignored, gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. It's overwhelming, to be honest, but I'm also extremely grateful and humbled by the interest. It reinforces for me that the environment in the public service is looking for this kind of research, and I think that is why it is resonating with so many. None of its groundbreaking. It's all known. However, it has been weaved together to tell a story about the public service and public service leadership and the real change that is needed, not just needed, but real change is a must if we truly want to succeed in the government's reconciliation efforts or any other complex problem public servants are charged with addressing. And while the current organizational structure is still hierarchical in nature, executives have an essential role to play in this work.<br></p><p>So the question that remains is whether there is an appetite in actioning any of the recommendations, particularly the recommendations that are system level changes rather than individual changes. Individual changes are easier and can be actioned relatively quickly. System level changes are much more difficult, take more time and require sustained commitment and momentum. And that can be really difficult in the public service. And I think that may be why we avoid or ignore those types of changes unless we are forced to address them<br></p><p>Ekosi everybody, thank you for taking the time to listen and watch my video. I really appreciate it. And I really do hope for those that haven't had an opportunity to read my thesis that you are able to find the time to do so.</p>",

      community: "Nakoda Oyade, Treaty 4, Saskatchewan",
      transcript:
        "<p>My name is Cleo Big Eagle. I am the director for the Indigenous Initiatives at Library and Archives Canada. I am Nakoda Oyade from Treaty 4 territory and I originally come from and was born and raised in White Bear First Nation, which is in southern Saskatchewan. And because of land claims and because of our history, which is another topic that I could talk about land claims and the history that we come from in that Treaty 4 area.&nbsp;</p><p>So we went through land claims and we have some land back. And so I transferred my band membership over to Ocean Man First Nation. And so there was three communities in southern Saskatchewan with White Bear First Nation and Ocean Man First Nation and Pheasant-Rump First Nation. So those three communities have gone through land claims processes. And so now I have family in all those 3 communities, and our family also reaches out to other areas.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I wanted to join in and talk today was about reconciliation. And so the work that I'm doing over at Library and Archives Canada is because of reconciliation, that was started back in 2015. So with reconciliation, what I'm finding is that a lot of people misunderstand about reconciliation. And I think when people talk about reconciliation, there's three big main pieces to reconciliation. So Calls to Action is actually just one part of the reconciliation process. And the first part is understanding the Principles of reconciliation and there's 10 of them. And I would recommend people to go to read their Principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So the Principles works together with the Calls to Action, but also the third part and the third piece is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. So those are three big areas that all are part of reconciliation. And sometimes some people I come across, they misunderstand that reconciliation is for Indigenous people to do that work. And it's everything Indigenous that's for Indigenous people to do that. And so that is a misunderstanding. It's for all Canadians and it's for all Canadians, it doesn't matter where you come from across Canada or where you work, it's for all Canadians. And reconciliation is about reconciling. And from my point of view, some of the things that we need to reconcile as a Canadian, in our own histories, as a Canadian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Canadians come to this country from many generations ago or for recent generations, and some of us have always been on this land. And so when we're reconciling as Canadians, those Canadians that have been in Canada for many generations and they have gone through our Canadian school system, whether it's elementary, high school, college, university, all the Canadians that live here, if you know, you've gone to in Canada education system, one of the things that would be under reconciliation and Senator Murray Sinclair has always talked about, is that education is a really important piece of reconciliation because it's something that has gotten, I quote, I guess &ldquo;Education has gotten into this mess, and it's education that is going to get us out of this mess&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>So I think education is a really important area for us to look at. However, I work with federal government and the federal government is not responsible for the education system. It's more the elementary school and high schools are under provincial jurisdiction, so we don't have any direct authority to change curriculum. However, I think as a federal government, we can encourage curriculum to be changed. And that's one of the reasons why I came over to Library and Archives Canada is because of the work that we're doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And when we talk about the relationship with the Government of Canada and the Indigenous Peoples of Canada, where do we find those stories about those very beginning times when that first contact happened between the two groups and so goes the Government of Canada as their government records that are held at Library and Archives Canada. So we can go to the archives and bring out information to share, maybe prepare a curriculum for people or information for them to do curriculum. And so those stories are there. And those stories is something that it will take a long time for all the stories to come out and to be formed and to be shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And I think we've started with a lot of the Indian Residential Schools, the history of the Indian Residential Schools, also the history of the Indian Day Schools and most commonly right now, you hear in the news a lot about the missing children and gravesites and unmarked burials. So that's an area that we're looking at right now and people are sharing that information. But there's a lot of other research that's happening in Canada that, you know, a lot of us still aren't aware of. It's happening in universities. And it's happening in other areas about all different types of topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So I wanted to share that with you about reconciliation and how we need to reconcile within ourselves what we were taught in our educational system and see for myself, I'm First Nation and what I've been taught in my education when I was growing up is different to than what I know now. And so I think I learn more about some of the things that in university courses and studying and researching history and also hearing firsthand stories from my family members who had shared those stories and passed down those stories. Because I think the stories that were shared is about our truth. And as Indigenous people, First Nations, I know I carry those stories and so the Indian Residential Schools system was not a surprise to me. The Day Schools was not a surprise to me. The missing children, unmarked graves, that's not a surprise because I've heard some of those stories growing up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So with that on reconciliation, I just wanted to share that bit about reconciling mean in your own ways. Looking back at what you were taught and staying open to learning new things. Because sometimes as adults, a lot of us, like I've been to school, I did my time at university, I have my degree, I'm finished with my learning. I'm not going to go back to learning anymore. And so I understand, you know, that feeling for some people. But I think in everyday life, what the teachings I was taught in my culture about learning is a lifelong, a lifelong endeavor, and we all can learn something new every day for the rest of our lives. And so I think keeping open to reconciling some of the things that you've heard and some of the things that you were taught in our school system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So I wanted to share that. Thank you for listening and have a good day. And I would say in my language, Ake-wa-cheemna-ginka,wa-shte. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

      transcript:
        "<p>Hello, Dokenyahunbi (hello everyone). Cleo Echwayatonka Emagiyabi (Celo Big Eagle is my name), Nakoda Oyade, Akewachimnaginkta. Wa-shte. I'm from Treaty 4 Territory. I just introduced myself. My name is Cleo Big Eagle. I am from Saskatchewan and the communities that I'm from are from White Bear First Nation and Ocean Man First Nation, my home communities. And I call them both my communities. But I am actually only a band membership of Ocean Man First Nation.</p><p>So today I wanted to talk to you about being a public servant. I have been a public servant for many years now, and when I became a public servant, was through a student internship program. But to get there first, I was in a different province and I had to leave my home community when I was a teenager just for to make sure I finished school, going to school in the country wasn't that easy in high school. There was racism in the school, in town. And so this student internship program that I applied for and I happened to get offered a job.</p><p>And I think sometimes from my culture, we are taught that everyone has gifts that they are born with. And also that the purpose that you have in your life will present itself in your different experiences on your path of life. So at the time, I didn't think about working that I wanted to work with government, but I did apply and I got the job and I started working for government. And so I started realizing that working in government that maybe this was a way I could make change for my people and, you know, try to make things different for people living in the community.</p><p>Growing up in the community, the things that I saw and lived through the community, I thought, you know, I didn't understand why it was different in our community than some other areas. So with that purpose in mind of trying to make change inside government wasn't easy back then. There was a lot of different obstacles. As a young native person working in government, sometimes you're looked over for different things. And I remember being introduced around my first team that I was being introduced around, and I was the only native person there and one of the ladies that she was non-Indigenous and she had red hair and she said to me, Oh, you're Cleo Big Eagle. And she had this different image of what she thought a native person looked like. And so I didn't fit that image that she had in her head. And so she told me that and that kind of surprised me that somebody would be that blatant to say something like that. And so the lady that was introducing me around, she really quickly escorted me to the next person to go, Oh, let's go over here and meet other people.</p><p>So I thought that being a young person, I wasn't really sure what that was until later. I realized, okay, that's what racism looks like, you know. And so different things like that have happened throughout the career, just trying to apply for different jobs. And you wonder why other people were, you know, given jobs or were accepted for certain jobs and we were overlooked. So I think nowadays I started working in government before Indian residential schools settlement agreement was filed and it was during the time of the RCAP Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. And I think understanding some of those things and the struggles that people went through to get to where we are today.</p><p>And this is what 2022 and where I'm working right now in Ottawa, in federal government, which is far, far away from my home community. But I think that if we're not in these jobs and to make any kind of influence, there won't be any change. So I think it's important for young Indigenous students to follow their dreams, follow their path, follow their gifts that they were given. And if working in government is some place for you, then I think that's some place that you should follow and make your difference where you can and I think use your gifts.</p><p>I also wanted to share about the reason why I'm working where I am, and the department that I'm working at right now is Library and Archives Canada. And this job is it's not a permanent type of program in government. We want to try to make it a permanent program. But I think the purpose of the work that we're doing is with promoting cultural heritage and the understanding of reconciliation in Canada to Canadians. And we are going into the archives and we're looking at the different collections to see what kind of things we can find so we can share these stories with the public, with all public, and with our communities and the people. And we're also providing funding program for cultural heritage organizations to help them build their capacity to build either whether it's the language or just to preserve their culture and their language. So this is something that I think is very important.</p><p>The reason why I think it's very important is from my previous work in First Nation and Inuit Health Branch working in mental wellness division. I met some really amazing First Nation doctors that were working on mental health and wellness. And one of the things that they shared that really resonated with me is that they said our culture is our medicine and our language is our medicine and our cultural teachings are our medicine. And so that made so much sense to me. And that's why I think with the work that I'm doing now with promoting cultural heritage for Indigenous, all Indigenous groups, First Nation, Inuit and M&eacute;tis in Canada, I think that is something that I think is important. So in 20 years from now, you know, we're hoping that maybe there won't be that many Indigenous languages being lost. So thank you for listening. Have a good day and Ake wacheemnaginkta (see you again).</p><p>many years now, and when I became a public servant, was through a student internship program. But to get there first, I was in a different province and I had to leave my home community when I was a teenager just for to make sure I finished school, going to school in the country wasn't that easy in high school. There was racism in the school, in town. And so this student internship program that I applied for and I happened to get offered a job.And I think sometimes from my culture, we are taught that everyone has gifts that they are born with. And also that the purpose that you have in your life will present itself in your different experiences on your path of life. So at the time, I didn't think about working that I wanted to work with government, but I did apply and I got the job and I started working for government. And so I started realizing that working in government that maybe this was a way I could make change for my people and, you know, try to make things different for people living in the community.</p><p>Growing up in the community, the things that I saw and lived through the community, I thought, you know, I didn't understand why it was different in our community than some other areas. So with that purpose in mind of trying to make change inside government wasn't easy back then. There was a lot of different obstacles. As a young native person working in government, sometimes you're looked over for different things. And I remember being introduced around my first team that I was being introduced around, and I was the only native person there and one of the ladies that she was non-Indigenous and she had red hair and she said to me, Oh, you're Cleo Big Eagle. And she had this different image of what she thought a native person looked like. And so I didn't fit that image that she had in her head. And so she told me that and that kind of surprised me that somebody would be that blatant to say something like that. And so the lady that was introducing me around, she really quickly escorted me to the next person to go, Oh, let's go over here and meet other people.</p><p>So I thought that being a young person, I wasn't really sure what that was until later. I realized, okay, that's what racism looks like, you know. And so different things like that have happened throughout the career, just trying to apply for different jobs. And you wonder why other people were, you know, given jobs or were accepted for certain jobs and we were overlooked. So I think nowadays I started working in government before Indian residential schools settlement agreement was filed and it was during the time of the RCAP Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. And I think understanding some of those things and the struggles that people went through to get to where we are today.</p><p>And this is what 2022 and where I'm working right now in Ottawa, in federal government, which is far, far away from my home community. But I think that if we're not in these jobs and to make any kind of influence, there won't be any change. So I think it's important for young Indigenous students to follow their dreams, follow their path, follow their gifts that they were given. And if working in government is some place for you, then I think that's some place that you should follow and make your difference where you can and I think use your gifts.</p><p>I also wanted to share about the reason why I'm working where I am, and the department that I'm working at right now is Library and Archives Canada. And this job is it's not a permanent type of program in government. We want to try to make it a permanent program. But I think the purpose of the work that we're doing is with promoting cultural heritage and the understanding of reconciliation in Canada to Canadians. And we are going into the archives and we're looking at the different collections to see what kind of things we can find so we can share these stories with the public, with all public, and with our communities and the people. And we're also providing funding program for cultural heritage organizations to help them build their capacity to build either whether it's the language or just to preserve their culture and their language. So this is something that I think is very important.</p><p>The reason why I think it's very important is from my previous work in First Nation and Inuit Health Branch working in mental wellness division.

        "<p>Hi everyone. My name is Laura Leigh and I'm an Inuk woman whose family originates from the southern Qikiqtani region in Baffin Island, in Nunavut, Canada. Not long after starting my career in the public service, I joined the Indigenous Circle Network at Shared Services Canada and was given the opportunity to panel and speak about my experience as an Inuk woman. These engagements asked simple but very thought provoking questions, one that really stuck with me, is 'Can you tell us the importance of your cultural identity?' It's now a topic I often think about.</p><p>Throughout my childhood, I was increasingly curious of my roots and culture and craved to fulfill what felt like an incomplete identity. I grew up in Lachute Quebec, which is 2000 kilometers away from my family's community. I spent some time there as a child, then went 10 years without seeing loved ones, smelling the mostly untouched land, enjoying feasts and embracing a community of Inuit culture.</p><p>If you think about your identity, you think of all the things that make up your individuality, including your passions, habits, dreams, meaning and purpose in life. Now, to have missing parts of your identity, you have a hard time grounding yourself. You don't know what path to follow, and you feel a lack of purpose. Nunavut has the second highest suicide rate in the world. Not just Canada, but the world. You can look at any statistical report and the Indigenous population will always have a significantly higher rate of suicide.</p>         <p>If you've ever spoken to someone who is suicidal, like they're struggling with their lack of purpose in life, they can't ground themselves and they feel as though they have no meaning here. Indigenous were stripped of their identity and I believe it directly impacts the high suicide rates among our people.</p><p>Until I had the opportunity to visit Iqaluit and be with my family and with my culture, eating traditional food and hearing my language, I struggled with my identity. I moved to Iqaluit in 2015 and spent almost three years there, and that decision has offered me more than I could have ever imagined. It's offered me love, connection, and a place to always call home.</p><p>Embodying one's culture often helps those struggling with their mental health. Many Indigenous led programs that incorporate cultural practices aim to help those with substance abuse or criminal behavior have been very successful in helping them heal. Providing a space for Indigenous to really connect to themselves, gives them the opportunity to feel grounded and be part of a community.</p><p>As a public servant speaking to other public servants, I'd like you to encourage Indigenous to be curious about their culture. Ask questions, because I love speaking about Inuit culture, being Inuk, my language and my family. Asking questions forces a person to reflect. And for me, it's a reflection of who I am, what I love, and my place in the world. Nakurmik, thank you.</p>",

        "<p>Taanshi kiyawow, Alison Seaman dishinikashoon. Regina douscheen, Regina ouschiniya. Senior Communications Adviser lii College at ESDC. Ma paaraantii si Marion pi Boucher pi Bremner pi Ross, ooschi Duck Lake, Meadow Lake, St-Louis pi Qu'Appelle Valley. What I said in Michif was: 	&quot;Hello everyone! My name is Alison Seaman. I am from Regina, and I live in Regina. I'm a Senior Communications Advisor at the College at ESDC, and my family names are Marion, Boucher, Bremner and Ross from Duck Lake, Meadow Lake St Louis and Qu'Appelle Valley.&quot; I am Red River and South Branch M&eacute;tis on my paternal grandmother's side and I've known this since I was in elementary school, but it took me some time to really understand what that meant and what responsibilities I carry by identifying as a Michif person.</p><p>So a little bit about me, my father lost both of his parents by the time he was 16. During the time while his mother was alive, she was in denial that she was M&eacute;tis. She would say she was French and she could pass, so she did. Her parents are M&eacute;tis and/or Michif. We can say that too, they are Michif and she came from a very well-known family up North. I can talk a lot about who they are, but I'll probably save that for another time.</p><p>My dad didn't know a lot about this and he didn't have a lot of contact with his Michif family because of the distance between Meadow Lake and Regina and then later of course, the death of his mother, his parents. Growing up, my contact with that side of my family was through my Great Uncle Sonny and Aunt Marie, who used to come from Meadow Lake to Regina every year until I was about nine or ten to visit us for a bit. Then, they would carry on to Winnipeg, but during that time, no one would ever talk about M&eacute;tis things or being M&eacute;tis. The only person who really did was Pearl, who was my grandmother's first cousin on my Marion side, and she had found my parents through their wedding notice in the newspaper and showed up and that's how she became a part of our family.</p><p>She was originally from Wakaw, but she lived alone in Regina, and she asked us to call her Grandma Pearl. Just in the course of knowing her, she would start to share information about the family, particularly the Marion so she would tell my parents mostly. But she also would give us some pictures and other little heirlooms that she had because she had no one else to pass them on to. She also was the one who told us that we were Michif. Later, in elementary school and through high school, I would sometimes mention that I had a M&eacute;tis grandmother and kids, sometimes even my friends, would tell me that I wasn't because of how I look and because I didn't grow up in my community. I really struggled with that.</p><p>In my twenties, though, I really started to delve more deeply into the history, and to try to learn more about who I came from, who I am, who my ancestors are. I spent time reading books, with the family tree and in 2007, I ran across an article where my cousin John Boucher, we called him John B., spoke of the time he spent, when he was a child, with his grandmother, Marya. Marya was &ldquo;ni nouhkom&rdquo;, my second great grandmother. I couldn't believe that there was anyone alive who had known her because it was a long, long time ago. I looked him up in the phone book and called him, but I afraid to leave a message. He luckily called me back and we got chatting, and he invited my dad and I to come up and visit him. It just kind of went from there, to the point where when he passed away, my brother gave his eulogy. I was really, really sad and worried when John B. passed because I didn't know who else we would be able to connect with.</p><p>Over time, my community ties had strengthened. An example being, it's really kind of escalated in the last couple of years in particular. A couple of years ago, I connected with another cousin, her name is Cindy Gaudet. The reason I found her was because of her academic focus on meeting women and kinship, and she was studying in Saint-Louis. In chatting with her, we discovered we were cousins at first, and then she brought me up to meet more cousins. I met more Boucher, and then some Bremner cousins, and we spent time discussing the matriarchs in our family. She's building a matriarch tree right now as part of her research. Then, she brought me up another time to Saint-Louis to sew a M&eacute;tis style ribbon skirt, and another cousin taught me how to do that. As a result of this and some other things, I've been able to see more pictures of my relatives, gotten to know them and feel much more connected.</p><p>In very recent times, I've begun finding more of my Marion cousins as well. These things are really worth it because our kinship relationships are always what have defined us, and these were severed with colonization and other factors, like in my family, the death of my grandmother. For me, knowing my community, being connected with them and accepted by them, really means a lot. The other thing too, that's really important, is reciprocity. That's something that's important to M&eacute;tis communities, and like other Indigenous communities. My hope is to continue to learn, but also give back to them as an Auntie, by preserving our history, language, that I'm just learning, and really it's important too because there are only about a thousand Michif speakers left.</p><p>It's really important, also, to reinvigorate our traditional kinship relationships. That's been really great in terms of being connected with Cindy and learning about that through her research. My advice to anyone who's nervous about reconnecting with community is: it can be really hard and really awkward, but it's worth it because it's helping to preserve our cultures. I just really want to encourage folks out there, who haven't done that yet, to reach out because we have always, traditionally, done things in community. We don't do things alone. I just want to really impress upon folks that, as awkward and challenging as it might feel, send that email, cold call that relative. It's time! Kihchi-marsii. Thank you very much!</p>",
