Hi everyone.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.579
My name is Laura Leigh and I'm an Inuk woman whose family originates from the southern Qikiqtani region in Baffin Island, in Nunavut, Canada.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.629
Not long after starting my career in the public service, I joined the Indigenous Circle Network

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.831
at Shared Services Canada and was given the opportunity to panel and speak about my experience as an Inuk woman.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.035
These engagements asked simple but very thought provoking questions, one that really stuck with me,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:38.310
is "Can you tell us the importance of your cultural identity?" It's now a topic I often think about.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.310
Throughout my childhood, I was increasingly curious of my roots and culture and craved to fulfill what felt like an incomplete identity.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.280
I grew up in Lachute Quebec, which is 2000 kilometers away from my family's community.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.440
I spent some time there as a child, then went 10 years without seeing loved ones,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.974
smelling the mostly untouched land, enjoying feasts and embracing a community of Inuit culture.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.439
If you think about your identity, you think of all the things that make up your individuality,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.749
including your passions, habits, dreams, meaning and purpose in life.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.569
Now, to have missing parts of your identity, you have a hard time grounding yourself.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.489
You don't know what path to follow, and you feel a lack of purpose.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:32.308
Nunavut has the second highest suicide rate in the world.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.779
Not just Canada, but the world.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.999
You can look at any statistical report and the Indigenous population will always have a significantly higher rate of suicide.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.005
If you've ever spoken to someone who is suicidal, like they're struggling with their lack of purpose in life,

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:55.660
they can't ground themselves and they feel as though they have no meaning here.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.670
Indigenous were stripped of their identity and I believe it directly impacts the high suicide rates among our people.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.615
Until I had the opportunity to visit Iqualuit and be with my family and with my culture,

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:16.330
eating traditional food and hearing my language, I struggled with my identity.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.929
I moved to Iqualuit in 2015 and spent almost three years there, and that decision has offered me more than I could have ever imagined.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.849
It's offered me love, connection, and a place to always call home.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.490
Embodying one's culture often helps those struggling with their mental health.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.059
Many Indigenous led programs that incorporate cultural practices aim to help those

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.819
with substance abuse or criminal behavior have been very successful in helping them heal.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.179
Providing a space for Indigenous to really connect to themselves, gives them the opportunity to feel grounded and be part of a community.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.149
As a public servant speaking to other public servants, I'd like you to encourage Indigenous to be curious about their culture.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.919
Ask questions, because I love speaking about Inuit culture, being Inuk, my language and my family.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.360
Asking questions forces a person to reflect.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.310
And for me, it's a reflection of who I am, what I love, and my place in the world.

00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:25.795
Nakurmik, thank you.
