00:00:02.096 --> 00:00:09.001
Kuei, hello, let me introduce myself, Kathleen Jourdain, I am Innu from the community of Uashat mak Mani-Utenam.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:16.719
So today, what I wish to share with you is a little about my experience in the public service.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.980
I have recently arrived to the public service, since almost 8 weeks ago.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:34.329
I am a senior manager on the liaison team at the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch for the Quebec Region.

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:37.600
This is part of Indigenous Services Canada.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:47.440
I wanted to share with you my perspective and my way, my vision of my Indigenous culture.

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:56.291
So, as I mentioned, I am Innu and this culture has been transmitted to me mainly through my mom.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.034
So we lived in the city, in Sept-Îles, but also in the community in Uashat itself.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:15.847
So, I have some experience, I would say I have a vision of two worlds that I would call, the urban environment and the one in community.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:25.730
In my life, I would say my personal experience has been rather positive.

00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:44.857
Of course, like most of us, there have been some instances of racism or rather ignorance of the culture despite the proximity to Sept-Îles,

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:51.944
particularly between the Innu Nation and the Quebec nation, the sept-îlien and sept-Îlienne who live the region.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:02:05.344
Yes, but throughout my life journey, whether at school or in the workplace, it has been greatly positive.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:18.594
What I would like to share with non-Indigenous people in Canada is not to be afraid of being curious, and do not be afraid

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:27.171
not to use the wrong terms either, and we are very politically correct, if I can put it that way.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.628
But there are people who have approached me and asked which tribe are you from.

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:41.908
It's important to have this openness, not to take it the wrong way, and then to inform people that we call it a Nation.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.002
My nation is the Innu Nation.

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:51.080
And, in Quebec, this represents nine communities, mainly on the North Shore, but also in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.900
It's things like that and not to be afraid to ask questions because I think that through this curiosity,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.720
it brings beautiful exchanges and a better knowledge of our cultures.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.870
And I speak about the Innu culture, because it's mine.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:20.540
I've been in contact with other Indigenous cultures in the country, mainly in Quebec, but, and it's expressed in different ways.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:31.873
So, maybe for another Indigenous person, the word tribe does not appear as derogatory as it could be

00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:37.893
for another Indigenous person in another region or another province.

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:56.581
So, that's what I want to share with you, to be open, to be curious, to dare to ask questions, to dare to ask.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.389
And then, I would like to tell you that for the moment regarding my new experience, in the public service,

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:08.191
there is a great openness, there are beautiful projects, beautiful programs that are being

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.419
put in place for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people,

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:15.500
to improve knowledge of the different Indigenous cultures in Canada,

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:24.516
but also to ensure that there is a greater presence of Indigenous people in the public service.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:42.562
So, I would invite Indigenous people in this country to dare to come forward, if they are interested in a career in the public service, apply.

00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:50.253
Sometimes it's just about talking to someone who is in the public service environment and then to see

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:57.250
if there are opportunities, openings, because in my case, it was really an unexpected opportunity.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:08.329
I would say it just came to me, without forcing things and it is going really well.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:23.815
So to summarize, I hope that we can move forward together, work together, know each other better

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:36.860
and build a bridge, make better connections, for a healthier and smoother cohabitation.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.329
But as I said for me personally, I haven't experienced any big trauma, but I know that for other people, it's different.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:59.916
So there it is, I wish you all a good learning journey and great discoveries with the nations and Indigenous Peoples in Canada.
