00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:08.584
Considering intergenerational trauma and the social background of First Nations people

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:17.747
in my workplace right now, I'm with Correctional Service, so I read clients' criminal files.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.300
And then, it takes me back to the past a lot, and it's really heavy and it makes me think,

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:31.664
okay, I can understand a little bit better why these people are incarcerated in the first place

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:39.834
and also knowing history, everything that happened in the past,

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:47.619
that different ways to eliminate us were attempted,

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:57.579
to prevent us from emancipating ourselves, to completely take away our culture.

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:02.815
I understand why these people are incarcerated and even in my own life,

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:13.399
I am learning every day from the reactions, ways or impacts in my personal life.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:23.113
For example, I see that with my son, my mom criticizes parental authority a lot,

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:32.177
but knowing that my mom went to residential schools, I can tell you that she has been through a lot.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:43.325
She had tuberculosis, she lived through residential schools, she lost her status and later regained as I mentioned earlier.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.700
I look at my life story and that of other Indigenous people knowingly.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.620
For example, I'm going to go back to the fact that my mom criticizes parental authority.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.772
It's normal because she didn't have a parent, since she attended residential schools.

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:19.538
It was a non-parental authority and her own parents were belittled by them

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.877
saying that their culture was not beautiful, that they couldn't speak their own language.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.590
You really have to adapt and become a civilized person.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:42.901
However, we know very well that First Nations people had their own rules, their own system, they were self-sufficient

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:49.409
and they lived respectfully and in harmony with other clans and with Mother Earth.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:01.870
So when I consult files or even in my own life, I can make connections with the tragic history of First Nations.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.710
It helps me understand a little better and it also makes me proud because let's face it,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.040
First Nations have strong resilience having gone through all the events of the past and having survived it all.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.627
In fact, Indigenous people do not want to be called victims, that are actually survivors.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:33.360
Today, I clearly understand that even my generation has suffered the consequences of all these traumas and the social repercussions.
