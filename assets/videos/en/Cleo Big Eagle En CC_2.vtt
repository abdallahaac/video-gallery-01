Hello, Dokenyahunbi.

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:10.354
Cleo Echwayatonka Emagiyabi, Nakoda Oyade, Ake wachimnaginkta.

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:11.350
Wa-shte.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.349
I'm from Treaty 4 Territory.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.539
I just introduced myself.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.340
My name is Cleo Big Eagle.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:27.570
I am from Saskatchewan and the communities that I'm from are from White Bear First Nation and Ocean Man First Nation, my home communities.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.180
And I call them both my communities.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
But I am actually only a band membership of Ocean Man First Nation.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.520
So today I wanted to talk to you about being a public servant.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:49.650
I have been a public servant for many years now, and when I became a public servant, was through a student internship program.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.449
But to get there first, I was in a different province and I had to leave my home community when I was a teenager

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:10.379
just for to make sure I finished school, going to school in the country wasn't that easy in high school.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.529
There was racism in the school, in town.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.069
And so this student internship program that I applied for and I happened to get offered a job.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.780
And I think sometimes from my culture, we are taught that everyone has gifts that they are born with.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:41.339
And also that the purpose that you have in your life will present itself in your different experiences on on your path of life.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.955
So at the time, I didn't think about working that I wanted to work with government,

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:53.610
but I did apply and I got the job and I started working for government.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.507
And so I started realizing that working in government that maybe this was a way I could make change for my people

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:08.497
and, you know, try to make things different for people living in the community.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.669
Growing up in the community, the things that I saw and lived through the community,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.159
I thought, you know, I didn't understand why it was different in our community than some other areas.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:29.009
So with that purpose in mind of trying to make change inside government wasn't easy back then.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.970
There was a lot of different obstacles.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.819
As a young native person working in government, sometimes you're looked over for different things.

00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:51.184
And I remember being introduced around my first team that I was being introduced around, and I was the only native person there

00:02:51.184 --> 00:03:02.806
and one of the ladies that she was non-Indigenous and she had red hair and she said to me, Oh, you're Cleo Big Eagle.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.029
And she had this different image of what she thought a native person looked like.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.699
And so I didn't fit that image that she had in her head.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.839
And so she told me that and that kind of surprised me that somebody would be that blatant to say something like that.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:30.629
And so the lady that was introducing me around, she really quickly escorted me to the next person to go, Oh, let's go over here and meet other people.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.389
So I thought that being a young person, I wasn't really sure what that was until later.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.949
I realized, okay, that's that's what racism looks like, you know.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.289
And so different things like that have happened throughout the career, just trying to apply for different jobs.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.179
And you wonder why other people were, you know, given jobs or were accepted for certain jobs and we were overlooked.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:06.381
So I think nowadays I started working in government before Indian residential schools settlement agreement was filed

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:13.200
and it was during the time of the RCAP Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.470
And I think understanding some of those things and the struggles that people went through to get to where we are today.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:35.970
And this is what 2022 and where I'm working right now in Ottawa, in federal government, which is far, far away from my home community.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.290
But I think that if we're not in these jobs and to make any kind of influence, there won't be any change.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.839
So I think it's important for young Indigenous students to follow their dreams, follow their path, follow their gifts that they were given.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.834
And if working in government is some place for you, then I think that's some place that you should follow

00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:03.529
and make your difference where you can and I think use your gifts.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:14.509
I also wanted to share about the reason why I'm working where I am, and the department that I'm working at right now is Library and Archives Canada.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:24.170
And this job is it's not a permanent type of program in government.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.319
We want to try to make it a permanent program.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:38.599
But I think the purpose of the work that we're doing is with promoting cultural heritage and the understanding of reconciliation in Canada to Canadians.

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:45.819
And we are going into the archives and we're looking at the different collections to see what kind of things we can find

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.284
so we can share these stories with the public, with all public, and with our communities and the people.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.190
And we're also providing funding program for cultural heritage organizations

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:10.498
to help them build their capacity to build either whether it's the language or just to preserve their culture and their language.

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:13.946
So this is something that I think is very important.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:23.941
The reason why I think it's very important is from my previous work in First Nation and Inuit Health Branch working in mental wellness division.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:32.899
I met some really amazing First Nation doctors that were working on mental health and wellness.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:44.872
And one of the things that they shared that really resonated with me is that they said our culture is our medicine

00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:49.820
and our language is our medicine and our cultural teachings are our medicine.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.610
And so that made so much sense to me.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.805
And that's why I think with the work that I'm doing now with promoting cultural heritage for Indigenous,

00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:06.960
all Indigenous groups, First Nation, Inuit and Métis in Canada, I think that is something that I think is important.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:16.250
So in 20 years from now, you know, we're hoping that maybe there won't be that many Indigenous languages being lost.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.170
So thank you for listening.

00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:21.804
Have a good day and Ake wacheemnaginkta.
