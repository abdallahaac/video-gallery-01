00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.235
Hello, my name is Chantal Chartrand, my mom is Innu and my dad is a Quebecer.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.674
My mom is from Maliotenam, a small village near Sept-Îles.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.249
I've been working in government for almost 30 years now.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.890
I have worked in several departments.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.610
I am currently in the last stages of my career, which I will possibly end with Correctional Services.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.233
I say possibly because in life, one never knows.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.083
Retiring at such a young age can lead to a lot of other things,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.364
and this won't stop after I retire, but I work in Correctional Service

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.257
as a development officer with the Indigenous community.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.529
As a child at school, I remember that there was a lot of racism.

00:00:57.492 --> 00:01:05.772
Unfortunately, often thoughout my life and specifically during my youth,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.215
I very often thought about ending my life because I was Indigenous,

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:15.790
an Innu, and because others made me feel different.

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:22.702
This was a really difficult time in my life, but looking back,

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:31.637
I see that it really grounded me and gave me the strength that I have today

00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:35.935
to change things, to make the world a better place.

00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:44.160
These were not values that I appreciated when I was young, I didn't like to feel so different.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:51.695
My mom, having married a Quebecer, she lost her Indian status,

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:58.687
so at a very young age my mom was already fighting for her rights,

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:01.910
to regain her rights as an Indigenous woman.

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:07.260
So I remember going to protests with her at a very young age

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:12.321
and I didn't understand the magnitude of this issue at that time,

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:19.162
but my thirst for activism started very, very young.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:30.735
I have always grown up in my culture, but at home, we still lived in a little bit of secrecy.

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:41.361
For example, an event I remember from my youth was when friends came to our house and we ate caribou.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.405
At home, everyone was welcome and made to feel at home.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:50.638
We shared food with others as long as there was some.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.906
And I remember these people coming to our home and seeing the caribou head

00:02:56.907 --> 00:03:02.583
and the next day, it went around school that I was a cannibal.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.615
It was very hurtful.

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:08.167
Afterwards, I think we develop defense mechanisms

00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:12.650
because I kept telling myself I am not any different than others,

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:18.478
besides the fact that I have an Innu mother who has all the love and kindess

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:26.448
to welcome others and the spirit of sharing, love and respect.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.169
Then I was made to experience those differences at school.

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:43.566
Later on, when I started my career in government,

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:51.363
it was during the Oka crisis and during that crisis, in the workplace,

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:55.255
people called names like me dirty savage, cigarette seller

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:57.601
even though I had never smoked in my life.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.538
So I thought to myself, my God, this is something.

00:04:02.748 --> 00:04:08.533
My colleagues were angry and I found this behaviour very unacceptable

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:14.319
in the work environment because I respected these people.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.381
I understood that there might have been some people living on the south shore (Montreal),

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:26.988
but I found out about the Oka crisis a little later by educating myself

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:31.149
and trying to see what was behind of all this.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:40.773
In a nutshell, all this has given me a thirst for truth,

00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:45.406
a thirst for sharing my culture.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.097
I think this is very important because often,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.922
stereotypes and prejudices stem from misinformation, fear or ignorance.

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:03.922
So, I told myself how can I make a difference,

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:08.026
because obviously, I live my culture 24 hours a day.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.997
When I'm in the workplace, I always think about the consequences or about the communities.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.112
How can I make difference for them?

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:25.686
Because these are my roots, my belonging.
