00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.160
Kwe kwe, my name is Isabelle Dallaire.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.609
At first glance, I am sure that many of you are probably wondering, well, what is she doing here?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.279
It is a platform for Indigenous employees.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.913
She doesn't even look Indigenous.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.030
That thought is exactly why I decided to share a bit of my story with you today,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.190
because I'm convinced that it is through open discuss that we will change things.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.870
One small thing at a time.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.124
Prejudices and stereotypes of the typical image of an Indigenous person are totally normal

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:36.168
since you have been taught these preconceived notions for most of your life.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.740
Be gentle with yourself.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.700
The feeling of guilt that you sometimes feel is normal.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.894
Today, I invite you to reflect on your way of thinking to better understand the repercussions

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.019
that these preconceived ideas can have on Indigenous Peoples in the long term.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.269
The way I dress, the color of my hair or the complexion of my skin has nothing to do

00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:02.390
with the percentage of Indigenous blood that I possess and that runs through my veins.

00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:08.653
Today, I want to help you to become a good ally, to trust you and your empathy,

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:13.229
because it is this that will help you make the right choices and have positive reflections

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:21.044
on how to ally yourself so that together, we continue this evolution, that we change this way of thinking.

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:24.849
Let's take action together today.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.031
In my case, the impostor syndrome is often present.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.109
At meetings, at gatherings, during public speaking, among others.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.140
The comments, for the most part, are based on my physical appearance which is considered non-Indigenous.

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:44.709
Every time, it makes me want to become very small and hide.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.390
And yet, my voice is loud, it is filled with courage, it is filled with strength, with resilience.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.763
And I do everything I can to educate people by teaching courses on Indigenous culture.

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:07.036
By taking the time to educate myself on the issues and standing up when certain comments can be hurtful so that it does not happen to others.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.505
I want to tell you that I am hopeful, because every day, as part of my duties as a Human Resources Advisor,

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:21.213
on the Indigenous Employee Talent and Career Development team, many will ask me how can I be a good ally.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:24.477
Simple. Be humble.

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:27.576
Be curious. Get informed.

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:31.483
Recognize as you do today that you cannot know everything, and that

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:36.174
there is always room for improvement in our own education about Indigenous Peoples.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.340
Every community is different.

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:47.446
I hope that my video today has inspired you want to take a few minutes to reflect and also recognize your good work as an ally.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.060
It's important to do it.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.860
It's important to congratulate yourself.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.390
I will end by saying, Kwé kwé, I am Isabelle Dallaire, I am a woman, I am blond with blue eyes,

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:05.945
Francophone, Indigenous and I proudly come from the Maliseet community of Viger in Cacouna.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.150
My hope is that you, in turn, will be proud of your choice to be an ally.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.110
Be real.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.870
Be you.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.800
Be human.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.902
Woliwon.

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:19.008
Thank you.
