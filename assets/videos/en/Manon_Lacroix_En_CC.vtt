Hi, I'm Manon Lacroix, I've been 35 years in the government.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.539
I'm Algonquin from the Kitigan Zibi, but I've not lived in the community.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.369
To me, decolonization has been important since the beginning.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:21.084
I started in the government, because of the culture has not been passed on to me

00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:30.480
some people took me under their wing and they were, I really have gratitude for these people.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.259
A lot of them I missed, they are retired now and some are gone.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.260
My mentor is gone.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.820
They took me under their wing to let me learn many cultures.

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:55.920
And decolonization to me is what I've always learned is that you're able to voice how you feel to anyone in respect, of course,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:06.288
but with your heart and honesty that we are able to live in a work community that the hierarchy is not as important.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:17.992
I'd like to be able to just knock at the door of my DM to share some thoughts about something we're planning for recruitment for Indigenous People.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:29.938
Or just say, you know, I think it's being overlooked that we should be working more on the retention of our actual Indigenous employees

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:37.465
because we don't want them to leave, pass on their corporate memory, be there for the next generation coming behind me.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.800
I would like to be able to share what I learned.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.329
And to me, it's a way to thank my mentors and people that helped me throughout my career.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.469
Hierarchy is important for work to be delivered so that we know our plans and there are different levels of experience and education.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.530
But it's not important when it comes to communicating how you feel and for the work environment.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:23.295
So, the payroll, does not become important anymore, it is really appreciated when the person is genuine and there to listen, that we work together, that the

00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:35.816
Indigenous employees' networks are consulted, or when colleagues elsewhere are developing a great initiative, not only consulted but kept in the loop.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:46.479
It's one thing to consult and say, I've consulted you regarding this initiative we're doing, but then you hear nothing, no news until it's just launched,

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.612
and there's no more opportunity to give feedback in case it would have been needed.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.610
Many Voices One Mind report card is very important to be in constant link with their Indigenous employees.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.944
Those that are known, I know that the self ID issue is one thing, but there are always willing Indigenous employees that have identified themselves

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:20.919
and said that they're willing to be contacted, even if there's one, two or ten or 20, there's always some.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.000
Yes, we have our work to do.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:32.830
We can ask those that are just voluntary and those networks at certain time because they want to be able to advance in their regular day job.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.550
Many are there and it would be our pleasure to help advance in the many areas for decolonization.
