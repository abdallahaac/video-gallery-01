00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.194
In the last 10 years, I've seen I've seen such a huge change, a shift

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:13.839
in recruitment and promotion in professional development, supports

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.484
for language training, supports for Indigenous people coming to work in public service.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
Young Indigenous University college graduates to come in.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.237
It's amazing the progress I've seen.

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:36.120
Because when they look back 30 years when they said it, I was saying earlier, 30 years ago

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:42.930
tried to, you know, build an Indigenous employee network,

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.700
create a Circle of Indigenous employees

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:50.063
and the kind of support each other, join employment equity groups

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:54.085
to kind of get a certain small budget to support our colleagues.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:04.449
Indigenous colleagues to also progress in the organization to to where it is now today, which all started in about 10 years ago.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.090
Maybe more, maybe less, but not much more.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.575
With all the programs in place, you know, all the awareness tools that are in place for

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:20.020
non-Indigenous employees who join the public service to learn about our histories to learn about.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.755
the stories, sometimes very hard stories of our Elders and

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:35.650
that they've gone through various difficult stages of their lives throughout Canadian history.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:47.239
But to see this information accessible to public servants is is it's amazing.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.241
The Canada School Public Service has an amazing platform

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:57.008
where you can learn about so much on Indigenous cultures

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:05.087
First Nations, Métis and Inuit and many departments have awareness programs.

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:11.158
And one of those programs I used to to manage through the

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:16.743
through Indigenous Services Canada and developmental programs for Indigenous employees.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.372
So it's a great place to be in my opinion, if you want to work for government.

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:29.532
It's a great place to be as an Indigenous youth

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:36.470
or non youth but as an Indigenous person who wants to work for

00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:50.780
Canada, for the government of Canada, to be part of a team that can change the way things are done

00:02:51.013 --> 00:02:59.309
in relation to programs and activities to help delivery programs as well,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.580
that benefit the lives of our Indigenous colleagues, brothers and sisters across this country.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.449
I encourage the youth to to really think of a career in the public service.
