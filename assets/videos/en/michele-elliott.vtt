Hi, my name is Michèle Elliott.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.930
I am a Mi'kmaq woman whose maternal lineage comes from Nova Scotia.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.709
I was raised in North Bay on Algonquin Territory.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.082
My father comes from Algonquin and French heritage.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.987
I moved to Ottawa at 18, which is also an Algonquin territory.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.786
This is where I became more involved and connected to the Algonquin culture.

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.251
My life has always been about helping others.

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:35.646
And since I've been in government over 14 years ago, it's been about helping Indigenous employees on their career path.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.656
I used to be the lead of two Indigenous developmental programs and would offer advice to our participants.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.179
I would also provide career guidance to other employees and colleagues.

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:53.230
In 2017, I was lucky enough to be hired as the first Indigenous navigator

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:58.140
at First Nations and Inuit Health Branch within Indigenous Services Canada.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.690
I was assisting Indigenous employees in the navigation of their careers by offering advice and guidance,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.005
as well as by helping them find staffing opportunities and being successful on staffing processes.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.501
A few years after that, I was telling others about my dream to develop an Indigenous Career Navigators' Program

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:23.590
and to implement navigator roles in all departments and agencies

00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:28.685
so that all Indigenous employees across government could benefit from these services.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:33.870
Well, I am happy to say that my dream has come true.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.405
Navigators have been selected in some departments, and others are currently being selected.

00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:44.825
Training for navigators started this April 2022.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.459
All navigators will be part of the Indigenous Career Navigators' Circle, which will meet once a month

00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:58.469
to share best practices and to support one another as we support our Indigenous employees.

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:05.775
I am so grateful to everyone who has supported me in my efforts to increase the recruitment,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.673
the retention and the advancement of Indigenous Peoples.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.689
Supporting Indigenous employees in a cultural and safe environment is so very important to me.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.737
I am happy that the federal government gives me the opportunity to do just that.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.909
Thank you so much.
