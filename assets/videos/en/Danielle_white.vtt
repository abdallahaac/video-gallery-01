Kmé kwé, Telusi, Danielle White, Wetapekesi Njuio'gonik Ktaqmkuk.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.639
My name is Danielle White.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.917
My roots are in Mikmaki territory on the west coast of Newfoundland, where I grew up,

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:19.386
and I'm of mixed Mi'kmaq and settler ancestry and I'm a member of the Albert Mi'kmaq First Nation. At Indigenous Services Canada,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.819
I'm the Assistant Deputy Minister of Strategic Policy and Partnerships.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.100
What it means to be an Indigenous person in a leadership role in the public service.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.349
And one of the things that I'm guided by and it comes a little bit from my background, as I said, I'm of mixed Mi'kmaq and settler ancestry.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.399
There are times where I've felt very much like an imposter, very mindful of the privilege I've had.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.024
And because of the unique historical circumstances of Newfoundland joining Confederation in 1949,

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:56.649
at the time, for better or for worse, the Indigenous populations in Newfoundland were not recognized.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.869
They were not registered under the Indian Act, and in some ways there were a lot of positive aspects to that.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.025
I think about my own family and if in 1949, my grandfather, who fought in World War Two as a proud veteran,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:20.044
had been registered under the Indian Act, he would have likely lost he would have lost the right to vote, certainly.

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:28.282
He would have likely lost many of his veterans benefits, which were something that his family, you know, relied on.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.050
His eight children, including my mother, would have been taken away to residential school.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.900
But because, you know, those unique circumstances, none of those things happened.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:49.272
My life experience has been quite different in that, you know, I didn't experience many of the disadvantages of what it means to be,

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:52.493
you know, a status Indian in this country.

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:57.283
But it also means, you know, members of my family hit their identity.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.759
They were ashamed of who they were.

00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:06.412
We lost our connection to our culture, our language, to the broader Mi'kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and New Brunswick.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.986
And it's something that our leaders actually, beginning around the time of the White Paper in the 1970s,

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:21.844
thought long and hard for, you know, gain that recognition, reclaim our identity and our status.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.610
And it was only actually in 2009 that I became, you know, a status Indian registered under the Indian Act, which is a bit of a weird.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.345
You know, experience to go through of the way of, you know, asserting and reclaiming your identity is to actually be registered under this very colonial

00:02:41.345 --> 00:02:48.830
instrument in law that was the path that was chosen by my community and our leadership at the time.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.159
But for me, it's always meant I've kind of walked in both worlds.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.353
And as I get older, you know, have a growing understanding and appreciation for what it means to be Mi'kmaq,

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:05.667
I have been learning our language over the last number of years and the insight that provides

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.880
to our culture and our way of knowing has been really profound.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.360
And so when I think about how I approach my work in the public service, there's a philosophy.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.120
It's, as I said, a bit like what Nadine talked about a Mi'kmaq philosophy.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.045
It's a relational approach that's called Etuaptmumk, and it means to eyed seeing

00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:33.851
and the ideas that you see from one eye with the strengths and values of the Indigenous world,

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.889
of Mi'kmaq culture, of our way, ways of knowing and being.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:47.629
But you see through the other eye with, you know, the best of what western, western ways of thinking Western philosophy has to offer.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.089
And so, you know, in my work I always try to bridge those two things.

00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:59.501
And the idea of two eyed seeing, it's not just something that, you know, Indigenous people can practice because

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:06.012
it's a way of thinking that acknowledges no one perspective is better than the other, but that,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:14.202
these two WorldViews can exist in harmony, and we need to be informed by one another.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.460
And so that in itself creates space for, you know, strength based, trauma informed approaches to our policy and programing.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.670
It's, you know, how do we co-exist harmoniously and how do we find that balance  in our lives and in our work and in our relationships?

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:42.149
And most importantly, it means coming to the table with a lot of humility to practice two eyed seing you don't need to be an expert in Indigenous knowledge.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.600
What you need  to come to the table with is an appreciation that there are things you don't know

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.050
and that there is inherent value in ways of thinking that are not your own.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.870
And I think that's something that very much guides my work.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.660
So, I will leave it there.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.249
Wela'lioq, thank you.
