00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.040
My name is Jolene Head.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.740
I am a member of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation in Northern Manitoba.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:19.879
I've been a public servant for over 20 years, starting in the Winnipeg Office of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, where I spent the bulk of my career.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.109
And I've just recently moved to the Acquisitions Branch to lead the Indigenous Procurement Policy Directorate.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:43.414
In terms of my thesis, my thesis title is Deconstructing Colonial Practices in the Federal Public Service and where I got the idea for my thesis?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.899
The topic came from my interest in leadership theory, which is the basis of the master's program

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.679
that I participated in, and as well for my involvement in reconciliation as an indigenous public servant.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.340
But I think more importantly is the personal connection to reconciliation as a Cree woman.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.774
And my decision was also based on my personal observations and reflections

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:16.669
that there was and is something not quite right about the public services approach to reconciliation.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:30.614
I think it is important to decolonize before reconciliation because based on the research, both from the literature and information shared by Niwâkomâkanak,

00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:39.040
it indicates that reconciliation cannot occur in the absence of addressing the systemic barriers that exist in the public service.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:48.950
The public service system and culture are colonial constructs which have created legislation and policies that have caused irreparable damage

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.151
to First Nation, Métis and Inuit Peoples in taking steps to decolonize as much of the system and culture as we can.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.189
Recognizes and acknowledges the truth of not only the historical impacts they have had on First Nation, Métis and Inuit,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.849
but also the truth about how it perpetuates ongoing colonization against Indigenous Peoples.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.809
It's for this reason that I argue that decolonization is an essential process, that reconciliation needs to support and not the other way around.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.819
Reconciliation cannot occur without decolonization efforts.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.909
Anything less ignores the systemic barriers that continue to exist and turns a blind eye to the culture that maintains those systemic barriers.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:45.589
So in my opinion, the biggest, the two biggest obstacles are the public service system itself and the culture and people that maintain that system.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.710
It's a massive system, and it's overwhelming to think about changing it in a substantial way.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.120
However, the research clearly points to the need to do just that if we want to tackle complex problems effectively.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.969
Public servants are part of that system and the current culture maintains the status quo.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.526
So we are also, we also need to change the culture moving towards one that is committed to challenging the status quo,

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:20.492
to becoming a truly inclusive culture, and to deconstructing colonial practices to make Canada equitable

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:24.668
in its treatment of minoritized populations like Indigenous Peoples.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.879
And what I'm currently seeing is a grassroots movement by public servants who are demanding these changes.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.469
And what we need now is true commitment and action, which includes dedicating time and resources by senior leadership.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.509
Senior leadership points to EDI (Equity, Diversity and Inclusion) , anti-racism and the Many Voices One Mind as evidence of progress.

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.918
However, some of these initiatives are flawed, and in many ways

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:58.388
are actually maintaining the status quo because they are not truly addressing the systemic issues inherent in the system.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.209
So the actions may actually be perceived as performative.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:14.400
I think embracing discomfort, particularly in the context of work around social justice issues such as reconciliation,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.550
it means growth.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.219
It means self-reflection.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.020
It signals a need for changing one's thoughts, biases and behaviors.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.470
I think it is the place for growth and learning.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.290
And this is the place where change happens.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.009
It is for this reason, as a public service, we need to become comfortable with being uncomfortable.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.847
It provides the space to have these uncomfortable but essential and real discussions on topics such as reconciliation,

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:49.801
which I hope will then lead to action both at the systemic level as well as individual.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.230
I was surprised and still am surprised by the interest in my thesis.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.645
I honestly thought it would go the way many other reports,

00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:07.665
inquiries and commissions have gone, shelved and ignored, gathering dust on a shelf somewhere.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.449
It's overwhelming, to be honest, but I'm also extremely grateful and humbled by the interest.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:25.040
It reinforces for me that the environment in the public service is looking for this kind of research, and I think that is why it is resonating with so many.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.980
None of its groundbreaking.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.990
It's all known.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.904
However, it has been weaved together to tell a story about the public service and public service leadership

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:39.649
and the real change that is needed, not just needed, but real change is a must

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:47.929
if we truly want to succeed in the government's reconciliation efforts or any other complex problem public servants are charged with addressing.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.850
And while the current organizational structure is still hierarchical in nature, executives have an essential role to play in this work.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.029
So the question that remains is whether there is an appetite in actioning any of the recommendations,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.609
particularly the recommendations that are system level changes rather than individual changes.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.589
Individual changes are easier and can be actioned relatively quickly.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.370
System level changes are much more difficult, take more time and require sustained commitment and momentum.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.399
And that can be really difficult in the public service.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.880
And I think that may be why we avoid or ignore those types of changes unless we are forced to address them.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.470
Ekosi everybody, thank you for taking the time to listen and watch my video.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.550
I really appreciate it.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:46.819
And I really do hope for those that haven't had an opportunity to read my thesis that you are able to find the time to do so.
