00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:03.283
Kwe Kwe, my name is Jolie-Ann Héroux-Brazeau.

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:09.549
I am currently working for Indigenous Services Canada, but more specifically for FNIHB.

00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:14.486
So I work for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.697
I have been a liaison officer since May 2022, so since May 2022,

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:23.571
I have had the opportunity to work directly with Indigenous communities.

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:27.474
Nin Anisnhabeekwee, which means I am an Algonquin woman.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.850
I am a member of the Anishinaabe Nation of Lac-Simon, in Abitibi.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.362
So, first I'd like to share my story with you because it's going to really help you

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:42.210
understand why I decided to work for the government and how my work is helping me

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.466
heal myself not only as an individual, but as a First Nations woman.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.610
So, at the age of five, I was removed from my biological family to grow up in Youth Centres.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.998
So, I lived in several foster families, several group homes, shelters.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.159
So for me, connecting to culture was never something that was part of my childhood.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.150
Then it was at the age of 27 that I decided to give myself this beautiful gift, to reconnect with my traditional culture.

00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:16.096
It is also at the age of 27, that I also started working for the government.

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:21.498
Currently, I am almost 30 years old, so I've been working here for two and a half years.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:28.900
Now I am going to tell you how my work has actually allowed me to reconnect with my history, to reconnect with my true identity.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.109
So when I work with Indigenous communities, I can really see the resilience of communities.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:42.432
And that is really a strength, and it is really a beautiful gift that life has given me

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:48.294
to be able to see how Indigenous communities are able to take charge of themselves,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:57.077
to find their own tools, and also how they organize themselves together to improve the quality of life,

00:01:57.077 --> 00:02:04.779
to be able to heal themselves as a people, and for me, that is really something that is very, very inspiring in my life.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.783
I am also the co-chair of the Indigenous Employees Network at work.

00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:16.493
So it's me, in fact, who co-chairs a network where there are several Indigenous employees.

00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:18.692
We often organize conferences.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:26.192
So I'll give you an example of a conference that I organized with an Elder who came to speak at a regional discussion.

00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:29.586
So a discussion with federal public servants.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:34.565
So the Elder came to tell the story of her mother who grew up in residential schools,

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:40.826
and then the employees were so deeply touched that there were some employees who started to cry.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.980
So for me too to see that there are other employees who are non-Indigenous,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.060
who are really committed to the reconciliation process.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.376
I also like to say the process of reparation because for me, that's what I do,

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:59.760
working for the government, it's repairing and helping communities,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.167
supporting them in the whole healing process that they're undertaking.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.680
Then it also heals me too, myself, as an individual.

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.484
So to see other employees who are also as committed as I am,

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:21.196
it's really something that's very, very powerful, that helps me a lot in my personal life as well.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.482
We agree that historically, the government has not always been fair with Indigenous communities.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.131
But I think that now, in 2022, we are really in an era of change, of evolution.

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:38.242
And for me, as a woman, to contribute to that is really something that makes me grow as an individual.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.599
So for real, ever since I've been working for the public service, I've just had good, good feelings inside of me.

00:03:47.663 --> 00:03:50.483
So there you go, I hope you enjoyed my video.

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:53.294
So Miigwetch for having listened to me.

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:54.460
I wish you a nice day.
