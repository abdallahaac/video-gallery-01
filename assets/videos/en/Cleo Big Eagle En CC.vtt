00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.550
My name is Cleo Big Eagle.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.139
I am the director for the Indigenous Initiatives at Library and Archives Canada.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:21.209
I am Nakoda Oyade from Treaty 4 territory and I originally come from and was born and raised in White Bear First Nation, which is in southern Saskatchewan.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.997
And because of land claims and because of our history,

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:32.444
which is another topic that I could talk about land claims and the history that we come from in that Treaty 4 area.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.289
So we went through land claims and we have some land back.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.110
And so I transferred my band membership over to Ocean Man First Nation.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.969
So there was three communities in southern Saskatchewan with White Bear First Nation and Ocean Man First Nation and Pheasant-Rump First Nation.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.990
So those three communities have gone through land claims processes.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.479
And so now I have family in all those 3 communities, and our family also reaches out to other areas.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.799
The reason I wanted to join in and talk today was about reconciliation.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.560
And so the work that I'm doing over at Library and Archives Canada is because of reconciliation, that was started back in 2015.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.540
So with reconciliation, what I'm finding is that a lot of people misunderstand about reconciliation.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.400
And I think when people talk about reconciliation, there's three big main pieces to reconciliation.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.439
So Calls to Action is actually just one part of the reconciliation process.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.019
And the first part is understanding the Principles of reconciliation and there's 10 of them.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.760
And I would recommend people to go to read read their Principles.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:01.340
So the Principles works together with the Calls to Action, but also the third part and the third piece is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.769
So those are three big areas that all are part of reconciliation.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.650
And sometimes some people I come across, they misunderstand that reconciliation is for Indigenous people to do that work.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.990
And it's for it's everything Indigenous that's for Indigenous people to do that.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.069
And so that is a misunderstanding.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.259
It's for all Canadians and it's for all Canadians, it doesn't matter where you come from across Canada or where you work, it's for all Canadians.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.690
And reconciliation is about reconciling.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:49.426
And from my point of view, some of the things that we need to reconcile as a Canadian, in our own histories, as a Canadian.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.749
Canadians come to this country from many generations ago or for recent generations, and some of us have always been on this land.

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:08.262
And so when we're reconciling as Canadians, those Canadians that have been in Canada for many generations

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:18.786
and they have gone through our Canadian school system, whether it's elementary, high school, college, university,

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:32.720
all the Canadians that live here, if you know, you've gone to in Canada education system, one of the things that would be under reconciliation

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:42.181
and Senator Murray Sinclair has always talked about, is that education is a really important piece of reconciliation because it's something that has gotten,

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:50.596
I quote, I guess "has gotten into us into this mess, and it's education that is going to get us out of this mess".

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:55.545
So I think education is a really important area for us to look at.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.119
However, I work with federal government and the federal government is not responsible for the education system.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:17.450
It's more the elementary school and high schools are under provincial jurisdiction, so we don't have any direct authority to change curriculum.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.910
However, I think as a federal government, we can encourage curriculum to be changed.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.879
And that's one of the reasons why I came over to Library and Archives Canada is because of the work that we're doing.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.779
And when we talk about the relationship with the Government of Canada and the Indigenous Peoples of Canada,

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:44.752
where do we find those stories about those very beginning times when that first contact happened between the two groups

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:53.953
and so goes the Government of Canada as their government records that are held at Library and Archives Canada.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:08.569
So we can go to the archives and bring out information to share, maybe prepare a curriculum for people or information for them to do curriculum.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.839
And so those stories are there.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.720
And those stories is something that it will take a long time for all the stories to come out and to be formed and to be shared.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:29.737
And I think we've started with a lot of the Indian Residential Schools, the history of the Indian Residential Schools,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.019
also the history of the the Indian Day Schools and most commonly right now,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:45.210
you hear in the news a lot about the missing children and gravesites and unmarked burials.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.419
So that's an area that we're looking at right now and people are sharing that information.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.480
But there's a lot of other research that's happening in Canada that, you know, a lot of us still aren't aware of.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.639
It's happening in universities.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.049
And and it's happening in other areas about all different types of topics.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.796
So I wanted to share that with you about reconciliation and how we need to reconcile within ourselves

00:06:16.797 --> 00:06:23.359
what we were taught in our educational system and same for myself, I'm First Nation

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:33.622
and what I've been taught in my education when I was growing up is different to than what I know now.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:42.569
And so I think I learn more about some of the things that in university courses and studying and researching history

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:52.958
and also hearing firsthand stories from my family members who had shared those stories and passed down those stories.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.810
Because I think the stories that were shared is about our truth.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:05.850
And as Indigenous people, First Nations, I know I carry those stories and so the Indian Residential Schools system was not a surprise to me.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.029
The Day Schools was not a surprise to me.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.490
The missing children, unmarked graves, that's not a surprise because I've heard some of those stories growing up.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.359
So with that on reconciliation, I just wanted to share that bit about reconciling mean in your own ways.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.680
Looking back at your what you were taught and staying open to learning new things.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:42.019
Because sometimes as adults, a lot of us, like I've been to school, I did my time at university, I have my degree, I'm finished with my learning.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.660
I'm not going to go back to learning anymore.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.519
And so I understand, you know, that feeling for some people.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:57.736
But I think in everyday life, what the teachings I was taught in my culture about learning is a lifelong,

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:03.782
a lifelong endeavor, and we all can learn something new every day for the rest of our lives.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:12.799
And so I think keeping open to reconciling some of the things that you've heard and some of the things that you were taught in our school system.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.839
So I wanted to share that.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.990
Thank you for listening and have a good day.

00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:23.008
And I would say in my language, Ake-wa-cheemna-ginka,wa-shte, thank you.
