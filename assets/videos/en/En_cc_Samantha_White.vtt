00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.560
Hello.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.452
Hi there shé:kon.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.059
My name is Samantha White and I am from the Six Nations community.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.119
I am a Mohawk Turtle Clan member.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.260
I am a daughter, I'm a sister, I'm an auntie, and right now, I'm a public servant.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.360
Something close and dear to me that I have been hearing a lot is I hear the same census data

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.350
that Indigenous youth will become the largest untapped human resource and labor force.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.990
I get really protective of Indigenous youth when I hear this.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.780
So my story is intertwined with the public service because I was afforded the opportunity to attend college and university.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.220
I grew up mostly in the Six Nations and Hamilton area, so I was all around a lot of urban natives, as I say.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.029
So I know so many people who can do as I have done but haven't had the same opportunity, and that's not fair.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.299
So a large part of my adult life now works to address that inequity for my own people back home.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.040
If I can lead by example, that's my first step.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.469
The second is preparing the system for our people, for our Indigenous youth.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.969
And again, this is where my protectiveness comes out.

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.579
So my path was headed towards the not for profit sector,

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:39.543
and it wasn't until I was actually rejected from the original program choice at the University of Ottawa

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:47.644
that I accepted their alternative option for me...But it turns out I absolutely loved the program.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.840
I can't say enough about my experience at the University of Ottawa and especially the Indigenous Resource Center.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.215
I lived there, so it's through safe spaces like the Indigenous Resource Center

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:06.900
that I was able to attend a targeted recruitment initiative for Indigenous students.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.360
Now this initiative, it's called the Indigenous Student Employment Opportunity, which is still open now.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.039
So, if you're an Indigenous student, please, I encourage you to apply.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.720
They're not paying me, I swear.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.230
So I entered the public service as a student in 2018 from that opportunity.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.860
And now, after a couple of summers in different organizations, I find myself where I'm at now.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:38.742
So I'm an H.R. Advisor, and it's been a full circle moment for me

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:43.030
as some of the work I do now involves the ISEO program,

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:46.077
Indigenous Student Employment Opportunity, and supporting Indigenous students.

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:50.385
So it's right now as though I'm giving back, which feels really good to me.

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:56.248
But now that I'm here and I've been in this role, I've been noticing some things,

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.124
I guess, like how we know it's a pretty, horrible experience to apply to work for the public service,

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.690
especially for Indigenous Peoples.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.310
The education and language requirements have us taking ourselves out of the running before we even start.

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:23.880
Actually, like I did, I never thought I could work for the government, for the public service, because I don't speak French

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.726
and I absolutely believe I know to be true, had I not attended the University of Ottawa and subsequently

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:38.326
the Indigenous presentation for the ISEO program, I wouldn't be here speaking to you now, at all.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:47.770
And I feel a hundred and I feel 1,492% worthy and capable that I can do my job and I can do it well.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.705
And I know other Indigenous People out there just like me, who just need this chance,

00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:57.400
need these targeted recruitment opportunities like I have had.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:06.189
So I see and am a part of many great working groups and I help support in any way I can through my position.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.449
But I want to be very clear that I don't want to get Indigenous youth ready for the public service.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.490
Rather, I'm working the opposite end of this with my protectiveness around youth.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:28.059
That and in everything that I've seen with my career, right now, I'm aiming to get the public service ready for Indigenous youth.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.757
Indigenous Peoples lived experience account for important learning opportunities,

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:37.965
just like the opportunities afforded when taking the traditional higher Western education path,

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:43.845
the path favored by educational requirements when staffing the public service, and that's not fair.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.610
How are we to breathe new air into a space when that space has barred it?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.649
On the same note, now many positions require bilingual language profiles as well.

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.975
If you look at the statistics or if you speak to any community member,

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.713
you'll understand how important language is, but rather recapturing our own that was taken.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.515
With just those two gaps identified, I can already tell you that the work that needs to be done

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:14.149
to address this must also come from Indigenous Peoples.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.169
Meaning to change the staffing of the public service so that it is inclusive and not just to Indigenous Peoples, but to everyone.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.045
We must have representation from all equity groups at the table and clear dialog,

00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:30.740
something I know many people right now are currently doing.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:45.860
So, I stepped back, with the last sort of thing that I do want to put out there is that my path again, as I said, started with rejection.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.265
I got, actually I got rejected in college, too, from my program,

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:54.670
so maybe it's just normal for me to kind of get rejected and come back.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.029
But I think wherever your path leads you, you go, right?

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.394
I don't want to put it out there that all of this is because I went to university

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:07.759
and I went to school and now I'm a public servant, you don't have to do any of that.

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:13.666
You know, I don't believe Indigenous Peoples all should work in Indigenous Service Canada,

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:16.339
you know, I believe we should be everywhere.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.729
If you're an Indigenous person and you like math, be an accountant.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.970
You shouldn't be forced to work on Indigenous files as well.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.279
So for me I think that I want to put it out there that all education is important

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.589
and I was again rejected and I still found my way here to this amazing place.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.139
So any path that any schooling is so important to me.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.399
I believe in trade schools.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.660
I believe in language camps.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.009
I just believe in anything that helps and heals your soul is good for you.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.899
And so with that, I believe those experiences that you learned from those

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.442
other those other experiences will be funneled into the public service.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.880
And through that, we will change completely change the paradigm of how we're thinking.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.540
So, I think that was a lot that that there.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:16.499
So for me I do just want to thank you for listening and that hopefully if  I can instill anything in anybody

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.464
it's that somebody like me from  growing up in Hamilton that doesn't speak French,

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:26.429
that they had no idea that I worked for the Government, that this is where I'm at now.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.640
And and you can do it as well.

00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:32.881
So, thank you so much. Niawen'kó:wa

00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:40.430
I look forward to hopefully working with some of you in the future. Thank you.
