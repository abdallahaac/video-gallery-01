00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.320
Hi, bonjour, kwe kwe.

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:04.650
My name is Jacinthe Grondin.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.369
I work as a policy analyst for Indigenous Services Canada.

00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.388
But who am I?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.269
I am a woman.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.980
I am a daughter.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.599
I am a child.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.309
I am a granddaughter.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.090
I am a spouse.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.768
I am grandmother and I am a friend and a colleague.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.222
I am Algonquin from my mother's side, so I am mixed ancestry.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.770
Algonquin from my mother's side, Lac des Deux Montagnes, but I was raised in a French Canadian environment.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.709
My family history is such as many women were my caretakers, primary caretakers in my life.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.581
There was my natural mother, my adoptive mother, was also Algonquin

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:56.902
and my grandmother, the mother of my father, who was from Beauce.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.605
But, and I will talk about her later.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.883
So, the Algonquin, Indigenous origin of my mother had never been denied at home.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.769
It was clear, it was there.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.835
It was said on a regular basis, especially when my father mentioned

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:18.810
how my grandfather was not eating well like he should be.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.120
But it was okay because it was just a 'savage'.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.248
So, not being, not behaving like my mother's family was the point for us

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:38.730
to be to put forward as a French Canadian family what we needed to succeed.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.830
We were from Beauce from my father's side, and that was very clear.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:51.190
Even if I was not born in Beauce and never lived in Beauce, and it wasn't like I went to Beauce very little times in my life,

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:54.921
being from Beauce was very strong in my family.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.010
And that was pushing us for success.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.739
We needed to have education.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.792
We needed to learn English, which obviously I learned late in my life,

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:12.039
and we needed to check the box of all the obstacles on our path for success.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.999
My natural mother succeeded very well.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.374
If it was not because of the Indian Act application that made a woman lose her status,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:27.749
when she married the white man, she would have lost her status for many reasons, including her master's degree.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.332
My grandmother who was from Beauce, as mentioned before,

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:40.156
she was fascinated by Indigenous teachings, and she was born in 1901.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:50.215
So, early in her life she got along well with Abenakis  and gathered and received a lot of Abenakis teachings

00:02:50.227 --> 00:02:56.027
that she passed on to me when I was a young kid because I walk with her and she was my primary caretaker.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:04.813
So all of those Abenakis teachings was part of me and she is the one  who taught me how

00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:11.113
a poison plant comes with a solution, an antidote just beside and in your life

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:16.380
that translates in that you have a problem, then there's a solution just beside of it.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.300
So, there's also her who taught me how to talk with rocks and stones.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.842
And my ancestry is through that and my grandparents and ancestors.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.389
So, that was part of my DNA, that became part of my DNA.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:45.620
When my parents separated and I met my adoptive mother, I was 11 the first time, and the connection was strong.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.247
It was like love at first sight.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.130
I fell in love with her.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.529
We shared the same connection with the land, with the herd, with the nature, with animals.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.800
And she, I could share safely the teachings of my grandmother with her.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.409
And she validated those teachings, and sometimes she corrected that.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.699
So we went in the woods many times together.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.199
We were harvesting.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.384
The story for my father was we are harvesting today some strawberries and we've prepared pie for him

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:24.569
to then to satisfy his need to know but so many stories, so many teachings she passed on to me at that time.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.786
Unfortunately, she passed when I was seventeen, and that created a big gap in my life, a big, big gap.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.325
I became a mother at the age of twenty, twenty-one and not having the loving,

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:44.910
the love of my adoptive mother and the support was like "who do I belong to?", I lost a sense of belonging there.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.769
So, I focused my attention to make a great living for my sons.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.620
I had two sons.

00:04:52.621 --> 00:05:00.977
I was a single mother, and I had the pressure to succeed for them to make a better living for them

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:06.113
and to get rid of the stigma of being a single mother trying to make a career at the same time.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:14.579
When I joined the public service 15 years ago, after being in law practice for a while,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.769
I was very, very attracted by the Indigenous issues and the reconciliation and services and that need for connection.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:34.481
But I was so afraid of rejection, of being told that I don't belong there and that then it was like

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:43.759
I was working around the issue until I became, I felt that I was afraid of being called an imposter.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.595
Then I became a grandmother, my granddaughter arrived.

00:05:49.595 --> 00:05:57.684
And then the call for me was, oh, my God, I do have to affirm who I am, to pass it on to my granddaughter.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.313
I'm in touch with my grandmother.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.039
I have my granddaughter on the other end, and the sense of seven generations,

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.962
that its nurture and value in Indigenous communities became real,

00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:15.909
very real for me everyday, on a daily basis, I touch five generations.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.600
So, seven generations is not that long time.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:28.580
So, this need, inner need to embrace that, in conjunction with having all these initiatives

00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:35.903
for Indigenous employees, put in place and promoted within the public service,

00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:43.153
allowed me to connect with some elders and to be more in touch with other groups and employees

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:48.831
who face the same situation and same life journey of reappropriation.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.589
So, having that puts me like, okay, I can nurture, I can progress, and I feel like I could finally be myself.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:08.339
Add all the aspects of who I am, the vowels and consonants together to have a full speech of who I am.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.529
I'm not half bilingual, even if English is not my strongest language.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.767
It's not like 50% English, 50% French.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.100
I speak both languages.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.059
It's the same thing.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.050
I'm Indigenous.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:32.730
I'm also French Canadian, and I want to embrace all that reality together, in my daily life, and professional and personal.

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:40.592
So today, the big gift in my life, that I've been given through my reconciliation journey

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:49.546
is having my natural mother, who is 85 years old now, helping her claim back the Indian card and the Indian status,

00:07:49.547 --> 00:07:58.453
even if it's an archaism of the patriarchal policy, claiming the same status of her family

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:05.407
and walking her path to the sacred teachings that we have this discussion about that,

00:08:05.407 --> 00:08:16.412
sacred teachings and all the Indigenous teachings to help her heal her own journey and wounds from that past history.

00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:24.377
So all of this to say, I'm more than grateful and chi miigwetch, chi miigwetch.

00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:25.447
Thank you, merci.
