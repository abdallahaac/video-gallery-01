00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
Good morning, Tansi.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.870
My name is Colin Oakes.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.410
I'm from the Nekaneet First Nation, Southwest Saskatchewan.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:16.239
I'm a manager of operations at Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge, Prairie Region, Correctional Service Canada.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.999
I've been here since about 13 years and I started out here in a different capacity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.839
But now I'm, now I do the work I do.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.020
I feel very fortunate to work on our Nekaneet First Nation.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.468
This is where the Okimaw Onci Healing Lodge is located at.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.810
I'm driving, going home, going to work under 4 minutes is so great.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.670
We have a fair amount of First Nations staff on site.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.149
We have a fair amount also from the Nekaneet, First Nation.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:59.770
That's pretty ideal not only for them, but their relatives that we have other First Nations people that come here.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.850
The, I think the commute for them is approximately 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.625
The thing that I enjoy about being First Nations and working here is

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.780
the fact that this is in line with what we do at Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.525
When this place was built and completed in 1995, the intent back then

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:33.640
was to have an equal amount of correctional cultural story interventions or ways of dealing with our federal female offenders,

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.085
and also a partnership with what would be called law and policy.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.659
And there was a good there was good intent there.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.590
And I think it's a challenge every day, I guess, when you have that partnership.

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:55.650
We had a good, strong group of Elders that used to work here back then.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.760
Many of those Elders are no longer around now, unfortunately, but we have another group of Elders that work with the women also.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:15.930
I enjoyed the part about this job as I do a fair amount of departmental or CSC interactions, meetings, videoconferences.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.310
But there are times I can pretty much step outside my office door and speak with the offenders that are walking by.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.021
I'll say good morning.

00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:29.950
When this place was opened back in 1995, many of the Elders that worked here,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.879
there was probably no how to work with the federally sentenced female offenders back then.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.979
So the intent that they had back then was to treat them like relatives, like they were their granddaughters or grandnieces or something.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.259
They treated them like family but they also had expectations.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.210
And in a way, they're able to probably, I guess their interactions were very culturally based, I guess.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.729
You know, they're basically, you know, raising grandchildren, also helping raise grandchildren.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.250
So that was the idea they took back then.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.305
And that was like, as I said, 1995, now that we're in 2022,

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.490
there's still a few of us that are from Nekaneet that we still have that mindset.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.159
I always tell them that you're they're part of the community, they're part of our extended family.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.909
So I think in that way, there's that good expectation that you have of them.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.914
There are also moments that you probably have those discussions with them that you have to,

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:38.199
for the lack of a better term, set them right.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.629
And sometimes those types of discussions probably aren't too great for them, but they understand.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.229
I'm also of the understanding that when the women come here, they're here to work on themselves.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.139
Like if you ever been out here, ever seeing pictures, where we're pretty much in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.620
There's nothing nearby to distract them, like, you know, a car lot, a block away or anything like that.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.020
They're here to work on themselves.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.620
And that way they do all the work on themselves.

00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:14.923
They do the work where we just kind of point them in the direction, the various departments, the Operations Department,

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:19.351
the Programs Department, the Assessment and Interventions Department,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.921
they pretty much try to point in their direction and all of them do the work themselves.

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:30.137
And when they leave, there's sometimes we do get contacted by women who've,

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:33.073
you know, gone past what is called a warrant expiry date.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.680
And they'll call us here just to say they're doing good.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.024
They're keeping some of the things that they kept from here at Okimah Ohci Healing Lodge

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:46.111
sometimes they even go so far to specifically name an Elder or

00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:50.198
they'll name one of the staff to say thank you so and so for telling me those words.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.560
They make so much sense right now that, you know, they're glad they had this opportunity.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.255
So, yeah, that's it's kind of one of the main reasons why Okimaw Ohci

00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:08.750
had chosen Nekaneet and I guess was our cultural way of life here.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.489
I again feel fortunate to grow up in this manner.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.720
So it's and at that earlier generation, you know, raised the younger generation.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.339
They kept us doing a lot of the cultural events.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.449
And that's something that we do now.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.066
I'm kind of at the age where I'm kind of one of the guys that sit around and kind of watch

00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:34.770
and make sure the younger group are doing the right things.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.073
And, but that's just how it goes.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.810
So, it's up to us to, I guess to keep that cultural interventions, cultural interaction going.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.569
I feel fortunate and feel very lucky to be doing this on a regular basis.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.800
And yeah, there may have been one or two times that somebody phoned here to say thank you to call.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.839
And so, that's all I have to say.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.609
I, do want to add that I watched the other videos.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.050
I thank you for your sharing that that's a lot to do and that's a good thing.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.978
So thank you very much, Hiy Hiy.
