00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:01.680
Kwe.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
Hello.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.970
Bonjour.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.864
My name is Andrew Caldwell and I am a Policy Analyst

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.759
with Employment and Social Development Canada.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.969
I am status Algonquin, Anishinaabe, First Nations and Settler descent from the Kitigan Zibi,

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:20.359
Anishinabeg community located in Maniwaki, Quebec.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
My Anishinaabe name is Wa-Wa-Ti-In-In-Ne, which means Northern Lights Man.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.200
My personal colors are green and white and my clan colors are red and black from the Bear Clan.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.285
I identify as Two-Spirit, although my peers experience me as androgynous at times,

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:49.200
I fall into, I present as a cis-gender, a cis-normative male.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.009
My preferred pronouns are he, him and they.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.624
My Kokomis, Algonquin grandmother, was sent to residential school in Spanish,

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:04.499
Ontario and was directly impacted by colonization.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.379
She died at a young age in a car accident, and her children were raised in foster homes.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.500
My mother, who raised me, was one of those children.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.753
My mother and her siblings grew up not knowing each other,

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:21.137
as a result of being in the Sixties Scoop system.

00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:26.569
They also grew up not knowing about their Algonquin culture or spirituality,

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.040
as a result of the effects of the residential school and being in the Sixties Scoop system.

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.981
My mother, however, shares that she remembers her mother being a Medicine Woman

00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:45.179
and that she was able to heal physical and emotional wounds with plants from Mother Earth.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.460
My mother raised my sister and I on her own, and as a child I recall seeing her oppressed

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.450
and discriminated against because of the color of her skin

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
and her long black hair, because she looked Indigenous.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.579
And she did her very best to raise my late sister and I as she waited on tables and she cleaned houses.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.339
And as a result of being in the foster care system

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.099
and in view of her mother being a residential school survivor, she did not have parenting skills.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240
However, she was very supportive of my development as a child.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.360
I did not know if I was a boy or a girl, but I knew I was attracted to other males.

00:02:31.362 --> 00:02:35.458
I knew that I was different from others, and she allowed me,

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:38.061
my mother and my late sister to be who I was.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.949
They supported my love for pop star Madonna, where I used to dance around and sing to her videos.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.914
And I had long hair as a child and I was very flamboyant

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:54.533
and both of them were very supportive of my development and celebrated who I was.

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.798
And throughout my school years, I struggled with my gender identity

00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:03.568
and my gender expression, sexual orientation and having Indigenous heritage.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.654
I have been subjected to homophobia, transphobia and racism.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.744
And during this time in my life I lacked direction and clarity in my life, so I was encouraged by my

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:26.909
mother to attend a healing center up in Kitimat at Wilp Si'Satxw Healing Center.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.550
I realized that my life was going nowhere and I made the decision to attend.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.595
And it was at Wilp Si'Satxw where a female Elder told me that if I did not deal with who I was,

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:44.130
in terms of my gender identity and sexual orientation, that things would get worse for me.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.580
The Elder informed me that I was Two-Spirit, which meant I was given male and female energy.

00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:53.352
She told me that this was a sacred gift

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:57.907
because I could understand and mediate between both genders.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.360
As gifts from the Creator, the Elder told me that it was important to continue

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.800
on my healing journey in order to embrace the gift of having two spirits.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.749
After that moment, I remember feeling at ease and very grounded.

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:19.699
Indigenous Nations have had specific language and terminology for gender identity,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.041
expression and sexual orientation since time immemorial.

00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:28.445
Due to the impacts of colonization and the residential school experience,

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:33.850
many nations are working on reclaiming their traditional language and practices.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.081
The term Two-Spirited is attributed to Albert McLeod, who proposed its use

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:46.343
during the Third Annual Inter-Tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian

00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:53.558
American Conference, held in Winnipeg in 1990, in order for Indigenous LGBTQ+

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:58.183
community members to have an urban expression for their identity.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.975
Two-Spirit is an English term that can be defined as an Indigenous identity that is gender variant

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:11.410
or of same sex attraction or pansexual and of spiritual and cultural roles.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.950
The definition of Two-Spirit does not neatly fit into the Eurocentric

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.410
categories of gender identity and gender expression as they vary from tribe or nation.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.064
It is important to note that the complexities of Indigenous histories and practices,

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:33.879
the concept of Two-Spirit does not apply to all Indigenous identities.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.030
Due to European contact, the Two-Spirit identity was denied by many Indigenous communities.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.754
It is important to decolonize the Two-Spirit identity

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:48.699
so it can reclaim its traditional role within the Indigenous communities.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.119
Various Indigenous activists and scholars are now working towards this reclamation.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.928
In current day, there are trainings and workshops for individuals who seek to gain an understanding

00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:05.720
of the Two-Spirit identity and explore ways to build respectful relationships

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.452
and foster vibrant communities amongst Two-Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ+ people.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.299
The Two-Spirit community is actively working towards reclaiming

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.209
their unique status in their communities.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.469
As a Two-Spirit person, I continue to seek the language and more teachings

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.369
on what it looked like within my Algonquin community.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.164
I am proud to be working for the public service as I feel included and celebrated

00:06:33.164 --> 00:06:38.751
for who I am as a diverse employee and grateful to connect

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.333
with others in the Equity and Diversity Networks.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.839
Thank you for listening to me.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.923
All my relations. Chi-Miigwetch. Merci.
