00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.788
What I said in Michif was: "Hello everyone!

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.360
My name is Alison Seaman.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.579
I am from Regina, and I live in Regina.

00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:39.303
I'm a Senior Communications Advisor at the College at ESDC, and my family names are Marion, Boucher, Bremner and Ross

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:48.478
from Duck Lake, Meadow Lake, St-Louis and Qu'Appelle Valley." I am Red River and South Branch Métis on my paternal grandmother's side

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:56.034
and I've known this since I was in elementary school, but it took me some time to really understand what that meant

00:00:56.036 --> 00:01:01.255
and what responsibilities I carry by identifying as a Michif person.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.284
So a little bit about me, my father lost both of his parents by the time he was 16.

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:15.505
During the time while his mother was alive, she was in denial that she was Métis.

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:20.720
She would say she was French and she could pass, so she did.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.560
Her parents are Métis and/or Michif.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.482
We can say that too, they are Michif and she came from a very well known family up North.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.340
I can talk a lot about who they are, but I'll probably save that for another time.

00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:44.451
My dad didn't know a lot about this and he didn't have a lot of contact with his Michif family because of the distance

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:53.738
between Meadow Lake primarly and Regina and then later of course, the death of his mother, his parents.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.134
Growing up, my contact with that side of my family was through my Great Uncle Sonny and Aunt Marie,

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:10.759
who used to come from Meadow Lake to Regina every year until I was about, nine or ten to visit us for a bit.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.627
Then, they would carry on to Winnipeg, but during that time, no one would ever talk about Métis things or being Métis.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.034
The only person who really did was Pearl, who was my grandmother's first cousin on my Marion side,

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:36.639
and she had found my parents through their wedding notice in the newspaper and showed up and that's how she became a part of our family.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.650
She was originally from Wakaw, but she lived alone in Regina, and she asked us to call her Grandma Pearl.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:56.924
Just in the course of knowing her, she would start to share information about the family, particularly the Marion so she would tell my parents mostly.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.319
But she also would give us some pictures and other little heirlooms that she had because she had no one else to pass them on to.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.864
She also was the one who told us that we were Michif.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.423
Later, in elementary school and through high school, I would sometimes mention that I had a Métis grandmother and kids, sometimes even my friends,

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:28.014
would tell me that I wasn't because of how I look and because I didn't grow up in my community.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.819
I really struggled with that.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:45.159
In my twenties, though, I really started to delve more deeply into the history, and to try to learn more about who I came from, who I am, who my ancestors are.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:57.841
I spent time reading books, with the family tree and in 2007, I ran across an article where my cousin John Boucher,

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:04.799
we called him John B., spoke of the time he spent, when he was a child, with his grandmother, Marya.

00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:11.800
Marya was ni nouhkom, my second great grandmother.

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:22.066
I couldn't believe that there was anyone alive who had known her because it was a long, long time ago.

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:28.379
I looked him up in the phone book and cold called him, but I afraid to leave a message.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.380
He luckily called me back and we got chatting, and he invited my dad and I to come up and visit him.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.599
It just kind of went from there, to the point where when he passed away, my brother gave his eulogy.

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:49.272
I was really, really sad and worried when John B.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.980
passed because I didn't know who else we would be able to connect with.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.809
Over time, my community ties had strengthened.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.540
An example being, it's really kind of escalated in the last couple of years in particular.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.486
A couple of years ago, I connected with another cousin, her name is Cindy Gaudet.

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:20.074
The reason I found her was because of her academic focus on Métis women and kinship, and she was studying in Saint-Louis.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:30.251
In chatting with her, we discovered we were cousins at first, and then she brought me up to meet more cousins.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:41.110
I met more Boucher, and then some Bremner cousins, and we spent time discussing the matriarchs in our family.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.339
She's building a matriarch tree right now as part of her research.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:53.670
Then, she brought me up another time to Saint-Louis to sew a Métis style ribbon skirt, and another cousin taught me how to do that.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:06.822
As a result of this and some other things, I've been able to see more pictures of my relatives, gotten to know them and feel much more connected.

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:13.354
In very recent times, I've begun finding more of my Marion cousins as well.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.595
These things are really worth it because our kinship relationships are always what have defined us,

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:30.740
and these were severed with colonization and other factors, like in my family, the death of my grandmother.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:40.717
For me, knowing my community, being connected with them and accepted by them, really means a lot.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.640
The other thing too, that's really important, is reciprocity.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.149
That's something that's important to Métis communities, and like other Indigenous communities.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:59.071
My hope is to continue to learn, but also give back to them as an Auntie, by preserving our history, language, that I'm just learning,

00:06:59.582 --> 00:07:05.821
and really it's important too because there are only about a thousand Michif speakers left.

00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:12.988
It's really important, also, to reinvigorate our traditional kinship relationships.

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:22.410
That's been really great in terms of being connected with Cindy and learning about that through her research.

00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:36.292
My advice to anyone who's nervous about reconnecting with community is, it can be really hard and really awkward,

00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:41.252
but it's worth it because it's helping to preserve our cultures.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:55.295
I just really want to encourage folks out there, who haven't done that yet, to reach out because we have always, traditionally, done things in community.

00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:57.252
We don't do things alone.

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:09.213
I just want to really impress upon folks that, as awkward and challenging as it might feel, send that email, cold call that relative.

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:15.081
It's time! Kihchi-Marsii. Thank you very much!
