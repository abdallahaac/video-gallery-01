00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:08.515
My commitment as a person is really I would say 24 hours a day.

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:17.176
During Joyce Echaquan's incident, I was in front of my screen when a friend contacted me and said:

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:24.237
Chantal, have you seen what's happening on Facebook?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:37.390
There is an Indigenous woman from Manawan who is suffering, who is dying and she is being mocked and ridiculed.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.600
I watched the video and it traumatized me.

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:49.371
It brought back a lot of racist experiences that I have lived in my life.

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:55.145
And that evening, I asked myself, what can I do to make a difference?

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:05.182
One of Joyce's cousins contacted me and said Joyce has seven very young children up to the age of 18.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.713
Joyce was also a grandmother.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.774
And then she asked me if I could do something to make a difference.

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:21.284
In our communities, when someone dies, the whole community will support by,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:33.131
for example, paying funeral expenses, offering meals to the family, soothing the pain of the family.

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:42.644
So that evening I said to myself OK, this is unacceptable, what Joyce suffered doesn't fit into my values.

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:52.409
I'm going to start a GoFundMe fundraising campaign to make a difference, to help pay for the funeral expenses.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.219
Humbly, I was aiming for 10,000$ for that's about what you have to pay when someone dies.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.449
And then, it was important that I meet with the family to tell them my commitment and also to have their agreement, of course.

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:25.379
First, I started with the idea of going on a vigil at the Joliette hospital because I wanted to denounce the treatment

00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:33.405
that she had received because no human being deserves such treatment.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.229
Finally, a lot of people got on board.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.779
And then, there was a vigil the day after she died.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.389
I met the family.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.474
Fortunately, in my current department, I offer peer support.

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:53.173
This has helped me a lot in the correctional services environment,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:58.289
to have an approach in crisis situations like this as we still experience a lot of them.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:09.870
And then, I met the family and they welcomed me and I gave them my word, my commitment that I was there for them.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.809
I think a mom is priceless.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.759
And then I told them, listen, I'm going to help you with funeral expenses.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.790
I started a fundraising campaign and in the end we raised 350,000$.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.932
And then, my commitment was to the children, to the family.

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:41.630
I first opened accounts for each of the children and each one of them had an amount deposited for later,

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:48.823
when they reached the age of majority and also to provide care, if there was immediate care necessary

00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:54.886
or at least to be able to enjoy little pleasures for the time being.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.889
I felt that this tragedy should not remain silent.
