00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.435
Greeting in Nuu-chah-nulth  language

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:17.613
Chuu, my name is J'net Ayaqwayaksheelth, one who gives away and still stands tall,

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.318
an Ahousaht woman from the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation. I'm a daughter of Stella August,

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:29.313
granddaughter of Ida Swan, August Shish and I have three beautiful children, Ocean, Thee and Taliesen.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.316
Thank you for this opportunity to be a part of sharing a testimony.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.579
I'm the new-newly appointed Director of Indigenous Relations at Community Engagement at the National Film Board of Canada.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:49.922
And in this role, since September 2022, it's fairly new role, and one of the reasons I wanted to come on board is

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:54.180
I've been a civil servant since 2014, working at the Provincial level now at the Federal level.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.389
I wanted to explore very briefly how I keep my West Coast traditions alive

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.219
while living in transplanted more than 3500 kilometers away from my homeland.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.859
And one of the ways that I'm able to accomplish that is because I myself personally am a textile artist, a cedar bark weaver.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.540
I do beadwork lots of amazing ways to keep my traditions going.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:23.963
So one of my ways I wear my art is by putting on my clothes in this particular jacket is from one of my mentors

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:29.605
that I look up to from the West Coast, from the Tseshaht Nation in Port of Alberni, Joyce Mahima Little,

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.450
so when I want to look my best I will wear something Joyce made.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.379
And the other way that I'll dress my best is I will wear some of my West Coast jewelry.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.099
So here's a beautiful Nuu-chah-nulth pendant with our West Coast logo.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.909
We all call it the graduation pendant that I got when I graduated from high school.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.259
So when I want to represent my community, my nation, I wear that as well.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.379
And even on my earrings that are black and red, which is a very iconic West Coast colors, we're not all Heida, by the way.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.054
I am Nuu-chah-nulth.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.549
We're not one good looking group of people, but what I've got here is a colleagues when I was leaving the provincial museum here

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.094
to move onto the National Film Board of Canada, she gave me

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:16.639
these black and red earrings so even other West Coasters know, like our red and black.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm a cedar bark weaver, here's how we wear our cedar bark hair, headband.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.300
My children moderned it up, my youngest wears his backwards.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.870
To him, it's more comfortable, it's less itchy he says because the cedar bark often bothers him in the head.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.900
And here's my cedar bark hat that I made that with the help of Geraldine, Edgar, Tom.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.664
So again, there's lots of ways that I represent my, my culture and cultural wise,

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:49.129
I also will bring my, my drum, my West Coast Wild Woman Drum to show that my West Coast ways are represented.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.114
I do have some tobacco ties and I'm made aware of tobacco ties here or when I'm invited to be part of events

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:58.017
and people want to offer me a customary gift, I remind them it is a West Coaster

00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:00.919
I would prefer a blanket, so I have a lovely collection of blankets.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.150
They don't have to be fancy blankets.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.490
I do have my my rattle.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.669
I don't know if you can hear it, but it doesn't have to be really loud because the ancestors will hear your ceremony.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.199
And we often will put our baby's teeth inside our rattles because it remind us

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.009
who were who were singing for our little ones, our children.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.833
So there's lots of ways as well through ritual, we have water that I do water ceremony in, in the work that I do,

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.609
where I'll have water and words that we speak in a meeting will be shared with a living plant at the end,

00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:38.009
so our intentions continue to grow and I will often bring candlelight,

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:44.380
which is often a common culture ritual that we can share across cultures.

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:49.705
But it's also remembering that as an Indigenous educator, Nuu-chah-nulth educator,

00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:54.444
I and as an artist, I often remind people that I work with

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.917
that we don't worship nature as Indigenous people, we learn from nature.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.860
So I'll be very mindful of what I wear to meetings if I want to invoke kindness I'll wear hummingbird.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.330
If I want to invoke eagle and have objectivity and see a bigger picture, I'll wear something with eagle on it or eagle feather.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.724
If I want to be sure to explore a potential and transformation, I'll wear something with butterfly and,

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:25.039
you know, bear if I want to be introspective and thoughtful and mindful.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.129
So lots of different ways that we can invoke spirit.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.430
And I will, like I said in another conversation that I live a block away from the Lake Ontario,

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:42.031
and I am familiar with the traditions this way, but as a West Coaster living out here,

00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:47.130
I find it really valuable to keep my West Coast traditions alive and represent my ancestors,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:54.991
even with my little bit of an opening and my candlelight and my water ceremony as a way to show respect for where I came from

00:04:55.353 --> 00:05:01.329
and keep those traditions alive wherever I live and my children are watching so they also learn how to keep those traditions alive.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.670
So thanks for thanks for listening.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.961
I hope that was helpful. Chuu
