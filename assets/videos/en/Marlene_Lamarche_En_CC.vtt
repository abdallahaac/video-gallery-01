00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.952
Hello. Kwe.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.809
My name is Marlene Lamarche.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.884
I am an Algonquin from Kitigan Zibi Anishinaabeg.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.070
I currently work at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
in the Treaties and Aboriginal Governments Business Management Unit.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.519
I was the first Indigenous woman hired in the public service.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.149
In 1990, I applied for a position in the government and to my surprise at the time there were no other Indigenous women working for the government.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.280
I had an awkward interview.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.340
I was made to sit in a darkened room at a large boardroom table with a panel of 12 individuals

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.380
who proceeded to ask me all kinds of questions from personal to professional.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.457
I was told that it was the usual way interviews were conducted, but that I was the last to be interviewed

00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:50.683
that way as they were changing the way government interviews would be conducted in the future.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.340
I learned later on that that was a lie.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.189
I was singled out because I was a native woman.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.549
I told myself that I had to be strong for my people, as I was a kind of an ambassador for my people.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
So I stood my ground and kept my head up and placed my hands under my knees

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.950
so that I would not fidget or make overly wide gestures.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.674
I knew that any untoward movement on my part would be used to judge me

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.379
and all Indigenous people wanting to work in the government in the future.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850
And I succeeded. I got the job. Yay me!

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.697
For the remainder of my position at that first place,

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:30.180
I made sure to conduct myself to the utmost level of professionalism,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.189
always being on time, always dressing for success, and never gossiping about anyone.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.560
Accepting any and all work asked and offering to help others when my workload allowed it.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
I told myself that at any time, if I didn't conduct myself that way,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.393
it would be an excuse for them to let me go to continue

00:01:49.473 --> 00:01:51.940
to not hire Indigenous people in the government.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.999
I felt a heavy weight on my shoulders in those days.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.729
It was not until I started with the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.953
that I felt more accepted as I was no longer the only Indigenous employee working for the government then.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.330
I was part of the Sixties Scoop.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.779
I was sent to live in foster home when I was three years old and lived at nine different foster homes before I turned 18.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.800
As the Bill C-31 came into force that year, I personally went to my band office and applied for my status card.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.259
I told my band office members my story and they welcomed me with open arms and gave me a new sense of belonging that I had never had before.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.449
I then started to attend Powwows and visited my relatives on the reservation to absorb as much culture and information as I could.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.509
I kept going to visit my cousins, aunts and uncles and my grandmother when she was still alive.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.789
She taught me about our clan, which is the Bear clan and what it meant.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.080
It gave me a foundation as a member of the band that I had been missing.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.749
I was placed with white families who didn't care about me and made me feel like my life didn't matter.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.349
I decided that there was a purpose for my life after attempting to commit suicide 3 times at a very young age.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.569
Since fate kept making me fail in death, I came to believe that there was a purpose to my life and that I would look for what that purpose was.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.689
I believe that Indigenous people may very well be the salvation of this country.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.069
It is important for as many of us to join the government as possible in order for us to influence the direction of the country.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.086
I now see some of the ways Indigenous people have changed the ways Canadian view us.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.979
And let me tell you, it's getting better and better every year.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.840
I used to be afraid to walk into a coffee shop in downtown Ottawa in the eighties.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.849
They would look at me like I was some kind of monster when I was just a small girl, for goodness sakes, what was I going to do to them?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.130
Native people see themselves as steward of the land.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.590
We are not now, nor have we ever attempted to take all of the resources of the land.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.129
The land must be protected so that our progeny can live.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.078
It is my hope that Indigenous people will live in a world where they are no longer seen as third class citizen

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.457
and can have clean drinking water and warm homes to live in

00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:17.327
and where they can hunt and fish for subsistence without the fear of running out of fish and wildlife.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.649
It's been an exhausting 25 plus years that I've been in the government and I'm looking forward to retirement.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.730
I've had my share of discrimination and prejudice over the years.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.410
I have mixed feelings about leaving, but I hope that Indigenous public servant will have it easier because of my contribution and dedication.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.239
I tried my very best to teach non-native public servant about my people in order to demystify all the misunderstanding about our culture.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.489
So carry on my people.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.810
But carry a big stick.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.810
Miigwetch.
